      <p>
        We want everyone to be able to build a store with Marktmorgen and to buy from one, including people who use a
        screen reader, a keyboard, voice control, zoom or high contrast. This page says what we aim for, what we test,
        what is still open, and how to tell us about a problem.
      </p>

      <LegalSection title="1. Our goal">
        <p>
          Our goal is level AAA of {WCAG} 2.2 on every page we make. Level AA is the minimum the law asks for in many
          places; we treat it as the floor, not the aim. This is a goal we work toward, not a claim that every page
          already meets it: the open items below say where we are not there yet.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="2. No widget or overlay">
        <p>
          Marktmorgen uses no accessibility widget or overlay: no button that promises to make a page accessible by
          itself. Those tools do not fix the page underneath. We do the work in the code of each page instead.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="3. What we test on every change">
        <p>Before a change goes live, these automated tests run on it. Automated tests catch many problems, not all of them.</p>

            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>

      <LegalSection title="4. What is still open">
        <p>{`Our records list ${total} kinds of page. ${total - reviewed} of ${total} still wait for a full review at level AAA, by a person, in every state the page can be in.`}</p>

      <LegalSection title="5. Creators' stores">
        <p>
          Each creator is responsible for what they publish on their store: their pictures, videos, words and colors.
          The studio helps: its &ldquo;Can everyone use your store?&rdquo; panel lists the products on a store&apos;s
          first page whose picture has no description, so the creator can add one. We never change a creator&apos;s
          content for them. We do not promise that every store is accessible.

      <LegalSection title="6. Tell us about a problem">
        <p>
          Write to <a href="mailto:support@marktmorgen.com" className={link}>support@marktmorgen.com</a>. It helps us
          to know the page, what you were trying to do, your device and browser, and any assistive technology you use,
          such as a screen reader. We read every message and fix what we can.
