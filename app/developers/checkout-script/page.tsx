        Put a link on any page of your own site, on WordPress, Webflow, Squarespace, Ghost or plain HTML, and it opens your product&apos;s card, or
        your email list&apos;s sign-up form, over that page. Your buyer pays on Stripe&apos;s checkout page, on your own connected Stripe account:
        the money goes from your buyer to you and never passes through Marktmorgen. Your page is told what happened, and so are your{" "}

        . Every plan has it. Make the code in your studio, under Checkout on your own website.
      </p>

      <LegalSection title="What you paste">
        <p>A link, and once per page, the script. This is a link made in the studio:</p>
        <Code>{example}</Code>
        <p>
          The link works with or without the script: followed as it is, it opens the card as a page of its own, whose buy button goes on to
          Stripe in the same tab. With the script on the page and {c('data-mm="overlay"')}, it opens the card in a frame over your page instead,
          and Stripe&apos;s checkout opens in a new tab, so your page stays where it was. With {c('data-mm="page"')} the script lets the link be
          followed and only says it was pressed. A link to {c("/embed/<store>/join")} opens your sign-up form the same two ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          {`The address carries its own tags: utm_source is the place you name (website when you leave it empty), utm_medium is ${SCRIPT_MEDIUM}, and utm_campaign is yours if you give one. A sale made through it carries them to Stripe and to your numbers, where it is listed under Where the money came from. `}
          {c("return")} is the page the receipt sends the buyer back to; {c("via")} is an affiliate&apos;s code, for a link an affiliate puts on
          their own site, which opens your product&apos;s page so your store&apos;s affiliate and consent rules apply there as they do to any
          affiliate link. Product ids are in your studio, and in the API&apos;s{" "}

      <LegalSection title="Your sites">
        <p>
          {`List up to ${MAX_EMBED_SITES} of your own sites in the studio, each an https address such as https://www.example.com. Only on those does the card or the form open over the page, with its buy button or its box, and only those are told what happened. On any other site, or when the browser sends no address of the page, the frame shows a plain link, in a new tab, to your product's page (or, for the form, your store's page), and tells nobody anything. The return page has to be on one of your sites too, so the receipt can never send somebody to an address you did not name.`}
        </p>
        <p>
          The frame knows which site it is on from the address the browser sends with it; the script asks for the site&apos;s origin only (
          {c('referrerpolicy="origin"')}), never the page&apos;s path, and a web page cannot write that header itself. Once you list a site, the
          cards you pasted with the frame code show the plain link anywhere else as well. Until you list one, those cards work wherever they are
          pasted, as before.

        <p>
          {`The purchase event: after paying, the receipt page shows a button back to the return page, whose address ends in #mm-purchase=<product>.<order>. The script on that page reads that mark from the address once, says marktmorgen:purchase, keeps it in window.Marktmorgen.purchase and takes the mark off the address. order is the same id as the sale.completed webhook's, so your server and your page can be matched.`}
        </p>
        <p>
          These events are for what your page shows. Anybody can make a page say them, so never hand anything over because of one: what was
          paid is told to your server by the signed {c("sale.completed")} webhook, and a confirmed sign-up by {c("list.joined")}. The sign-up
          is a double opt-in: {c("sent")} means the email with the button is on its way, and the address joins your list only once it is
          pressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Underneath, the frame sends {c("window.postMessage")} messages of the form {c('{ marktmorgen: 1, type, height?, status? }')} to your
          site&apos;s origin alone, and the script takes a message only from {c("https://marktmorgen.com")} and only from the frame it opened.
          The frame listens to no message from your page.

Webhooks are signed and retried as on every other event; a store has up to ${MAX_ENDPOINTS} addresses.`}

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="What the script does, and does not">
        <p>
          It listens for clicks on links that carry {c("data-mm")} and point at {c("https://marktmorgen.com/embed/")}, and reads that link&apos;s
          address, its {c("data-mm")} and its text, which names the dialog. It reads nothing else on your page: no field, no cookie, no storage,
          no other element. It sets no cookie. It holds no key and no secret: the link names only your store and a product, and the price is
          always read from your store when the checkout opens. It makes no request when the page loads; Marktmorgen is asked for something only
          when somebody presses a link.
        </p>
        <p>
          It draws the overlay as a dialog with a close button, closed by Escape or by a click beside the card, and gives the focus back to the
          link. It adds one global, {c("window.Marktmorgen")}, with {c("version")}, {c("purchase")} and {c("close()")}, and does nothing if it
          is on the page twice.

        <Code>{cspLines(hash).join("\n")}</Code>
        <p>
          The hash matches the script exactly as the studio gives it. A builder that changes pasted code as it saves it changes the hash too;
          there, use the link on its own, which needs no policy at all.
