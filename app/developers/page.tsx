          A key reads, and changes nothing, unless you check &quot;It can also write&quot; when you make it. That choice is
          the key&apos;s for good: a key made to read stays one that reads, and every key made before writing existed
          reads only. A key that reads only gets 403 <code className="font-mono">read_only</code> from the addresses that

          Money is in the smallest unit of your store&apos;s currency, before Stripe&apos;s fee. <code className="font-mono">sales</code>{" "}
          and <code className="font-mono">revenue</code> are <code className="font-mono">null</code> when Stripe could not be read
          (<code className="font-mono">&quot;sales&quot;: &quot;error&quot;</code>) or is not connected yet (<code className="font-mono">&quot;none&quot;</code>).
          A <code className="font-mono">channel</code> of <code className="font-mono">direct</code> is a visit or sale from nowhere
          the store could name. <code className="font-mono">previous</code> is the same number of days just before, to compare
          with; its <code className="font-mono">sales</code> and <code className="font-mono">revenue</code> are{" "}
          <code className="font-mono">null</code> when Stripe could not be read that far back in full.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each period also includes <code className="font-mono">payments</code> and <code className="font-mono">renewals</code>.
          Gross receipts include initial purchases and renewals. The amount after refunds subtracts refunds recorded
          in the same period, including refunds of older purchases, before fees and ad spend; it is not profit.
          Each group has its own completeness flag. Unavailable values are null, while confirmed empty readings are zero.
          Complete gross receipts remain available when only refunds are unavailable. Initial sales and revenue also
          remain null when the purchase reading is incomplete, even if the provider answered successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="font-mono">payment_channels</code> lists every channel with positive gross receipts,
          including renewals, in the stated UTC dates. Each share is a fraction of all recorded receipts (0 to 1).
          Direct, unrecorded and imported origins have <code className="font-mono">identified: false</code> and remain
          in the denominator. The list is not capped. An empty list with complete true means no receipts; complete
          false means the reading is unavailable. Refund availability does not block confirmed receipt channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="font-mono">payment_comparison</code> compares gross receipts with the immediately preceding
          period of equal length for 7 and 30 days, including channels present in only one period. It provides the
          earlier UTC dates and total, changes in money, fractional growth and changes in channel share. Multiply
          share changes by 100 for percentage points. Growth is null when the earlier amount is zero. Comparison
          is unavailable for 90 days or when either period cannot be read completely; complete is false and rows
          are empty, while confirmed current receipts may remain available.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="font-mono">refund_activity</code> provides refund records and amounts by channel for
          the stated UTC dates. Its share compares refunded money with gross receipts in the same period,
          including renewals. It is not the fraction of buyers or purchases refunded: refunds can concern older
          purchases and the ratio can exceed 1. Share is null when receipts are zero. A complete empty list means
          no refund activity; incomplete readings have null totals and an empty list. Confirmed gross receipt
          reports remain available independently.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="font-mono">buyer_channels</code> groups buyers by the channel of their first observed
          purchase in each 7-, 30- or 90-day window, not their lifetime first purchase. It includes buyers, repeat
          buyers, orders and observed purchase revenue before refunds and fees, excluding subscription renewals.
          Thirty-day repeat rates are fractions based only on buyers with 30 full days observed; the rate is null
          when none are eligible. Unidentified orders are reported separately. Incomplete purchase history makes
          this group unavailable, with null unidentified-order counts and empty rows. A complete empty group is
          a confirmed empty reading. No buyer identities are exposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the response root, <code className="font-mono">weekly_buyer_cohorts</code> groups buyers by the UTC
          Monday of their first observed purchase week. It includes the observation date and 7-, 30-, 60- and
          90-day eligible-buyer counts, repeat counts and fractional rates. Each rate uses only buyers with the
          full observation window; no eligible buyers means null, not zero. History is limited to the purchases
          read by the platform. Missing or incomplete history makes this group unavailable, while a complete
          empty reading remains available. Unidentified orders are separate and no identities are included.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each period includes <code className="font-mono">daily_payments</code>, with UTC dates, gross receipts
          including renewals, refunds recorded that day and amounts after refunds, before fees and ad spend.
          Separate payment and refund coverage flags distinguish unavailable readings from real zero amounts.
          Missing refund coverage leaves confirmed daily receipts available but refunded and after_refunds null.
          Complete readings include days with zero activity. Refunds of older purchases can produce a negative
          daily result. Incomplete payment readings have no daily rows.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="font-mono">campaign_results</code> exposes every recorded campaign in each period:
          visits, paid purchase records, purchase revenue before refunds and fees, and the channels of those
          payments. Campaign tags aggregate across channels; they do not provide a traffic split by channel.
          Subscription renewals are excluded. Incomplete purchase readings preserve campaign visits while
          paid amounts and payment channels remain null. A null channel list means unavailable origin detail;
          an empty list means zero paid records. Available empty reports are distinct from missing reports.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code className="font-mono">ads</code> and <code className="font-mono">sales_by_country</code> lists
          return at most 20 entries. Their total counts and truncated flags indicate whether more recorded
          entries exist. The existing completeness flags describe reading coverage, not whether the response
          contains every entry. Unknown readings have null counts and truncated flags; confirmed empty readings
          have zero counts and false flags. Do not sum a truncated list as the full period total.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use <code className="font-mono">/api/v1/stats?details=all</code> to retrieve every recorded ad variant
          and buyer country in each period. Default requests retain the 20-entry limit. The same authentication
          and reading-coverage rules apply: requesting all details does not expose incomplete paid readings.
          Complete full lists have false truncation flags. Ad variants keep their channel and campaign, so the
          same creative name in different campaigns or channels remains distinct.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="font-mono">attribution</code> compares purchase counts and revenue by the last visit,
          first visit and the origin buyers reported, using the same channel groups as the studio. These are
          alternative views of the same purchases; do not add the columns. Unidentified last and first visits
          remain separate, with survey answers for unidentified last visits. Missing first-visit history leaves
          its figures null and first_visit_complete false. Incomplete paid readings make the entire comparison
          unavailable. The configured attribution window is reported when known. Renewals are excluded, and
          no individual survey answers or buyer identities are exposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each window includes <code className="font-mono">period</code> with UTC start and end dates, the
          requested length and the number of returned days. Calendar completeness requires the full requested
          sequence of consecutive valid dates; gaps, duplicates and short histories make it false. Missing or
          invalid dates are not replaced with invented dates. This describes date coverage, independently of
          payment coverage. The last day can still be in progress; complete calendar coverage does not mean
          that today has finished or that financial readings are complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="font-mono">previous.available</code> indicates whether the preceding period was read.
          When it is false, previous visitors, page views, checkouts, sales and revenue are null, rather than
          invented zeros. Confirmed empty periods retain zero traffic. Availability of previous traffic does
          not confirm paid coverage: previous paid values still require a complete purchase reading. Current
          results remain independent of missing previous history. Availability is carried from the underlying
          traffic reading, so older snapshots without that history do not acquire an artificial zero baseline.

          unit, and is <code className="font-mono">null</code> if Stripe gave no discount details.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="font-mono">paid_at</code> is when the buyer paid: the charge, or for a membership or
          payment plan, when its first invoice was paid (with a free trial, that invoice is for $0, so this is when the
          trial began). It is not when the checkout page was opened. It is{" "}
          <code className="font-mono">null</code> when nothing was charged at checkout, such as a free order.{" "}
          <code className="font-mono">currency</code> is always the three-letter code Stripe gave: if Stripe did not
          give one for a sale, the answer is 502 <code className="font-mono">unavailable</code>, never a guessed{" "}
          <code className="font-mono">usd</code>.

        <p>
          Products checked at checkout are in <code className="font-mono">order_bumps</code>, in the order of their boxes,
          and the first is also in <code className="font-mono">order_bump</code>; a bundle&apos;s products are in{" "}
          <code className="font-mono">bundle_items</code>, which is <code className="font-mono">null</code> when there is
          no bundle. A product&apos;s <code className="font-mono">title</code> is{" "}
          <code className="font-mono">null</code> when the product is no longer in your store

          A one-click extra taken after the checkout (an upsell) is its own payment, not a checkout, so it is not on this
          list: the <code className="font-mono">sale.completed</code> webhook with{" "}
          <code className="font-mono">&quot;kind&quot;: &quot;upsell&quot;</code> tells you of each one.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="font-mono">refunded_cents</code> and <code className="font-mono">disputed</code> are not in the
          webhook, which is sent when the sale is made. For a one-time payment they are read from its charge when you
          call: how much of it was refunded so far, in the same unit as <code className="font-mono">amount_cents</code>, and
          whether the buyer disputed it. For a membership or payment plan, and when nothing was charged, both are{" "}
          <code className="font-mono">null</code>: not read here, which is not the same as none. Add the{" "}
          <code className="font-mono">refund.issued</code> and <code className="font-mono">dispute.opened</code> webhooks in
          your studio to be told of each one, or read them in Stripe&apos;s own API with your own Stripe key.
        </p>
        <p>
          The list is in the order Stripe keeps checkouts: newest first by{" "}
          <code className="font-mono">opened_at</code>, when the checkout page was opened, not by{" "}
          <code className="font-mono">paid_at</code>. A buyer can open a checkout and pay later, and some payment methods,
          such as bank debits, settle days after that, so a sale can appear below sales you already read. To keep a copy
          in step, read again from the top each time and go on until a sale&apos;s{" "}
          <code className="font-mono">opened_at</code> is earlier than your last read, less a margin: at least 24 hours,
          and a week or more if your store takes payment methods that settle later. Use{" "}
          <code className="font-mono">checkout_session</code> to skip a sale you already have.

          {`Texts are cut to a fixed length, so a page stays small: a product's title from the checkout to ${SALE_TEXT_LIMITS.title} characters, the buyer's name to ${SALE_TEXT_LIMITS.name}, each utm tag to ${SALE_TEXT_LIMITS.utm} and the site to ${SALE_TEXT_LIMITS.site}, with control characters left out. Lengths are counted in UTF-16 code units, as JavaScript counts them, so an emoji counts as 2. An email address longer than ${SALE_TEXT_LIMITS.email} characters is not a real one, so it is null rather than cut, and so is one holding a control character.`}{" "}
          <code className="font-mono">product.id</code> and <code className="font-mono">option</code> are{" "}
          <code className="font-mono">null</code> when the id stored on the checkout is not shaped like an id (letters,
          digits, hyphens and underscores, up to 64).

        <p>
          A <code className="font-mono">cursor</code> this list did not give, or sent twice, is answered 400{" "}
          <code className="font-mono">invalid_cursor</code>: start again without one. If Stripe is busy with your account,
          the answer is 503 with <code className="font-mono">Retry-After</code>. If Stripe&apos;s answer cannot be read
          whole, the answer is 502 <code className="font-mono">unavailable</code>, never a page with guessed amounts.
