/**
 * A certificate of completion as a PDF file (lib/certificate-pdf.ts): the
 * same record the page shows, under the store that issued it; or, at
 * /certificate/sample/pdf?product=<id>, the sample a creator looks at before
 * any student has finished, stamped as one. A withdrawn
 * certificate has no file, and one whose name is in a script the file's
 * letters do not cover is sent back to its page, which prints it.
 *
 * Drawing a file is paid for before it is drawn (C3, 4 November 2026): one of
 * the store's public requests before anything is read, and the rest of
 * CERTIFICATE_PDF_UNITS before the file is made, on the public side for a
 * certificate too: its address is public (a check, a LinkedIn post), so
 * strangers opening it never spend what is kept for the store's buyers.
 * Past them the store is resting and nothing is drawn. The sample is the
 * same for everyone for a while, so the CDN keeps it five minutes: short,
 * so a course whose certificate is switched off or a store whose look
 * changes shows it within minutes. A certificate can be withdrawn, so no
 * cache keeps one: the browser asks every time, and gets "not modified",
 * without the file being drawn again, only while the record and the store's
 * look are the same and it is not withdrawn.
