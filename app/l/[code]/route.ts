 * A short link for a post (lib/short-links.ts): sends the person to the page

 * the post's row in the numbers. Kept by the CDN for five minutes, so a link
 * opened a great many times is mostly answered without reaching the server.
 * A link that was ended, or never was, opens the page that says so.
