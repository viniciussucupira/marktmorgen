/**
 * Every page on this site that is worth finding, listed for search engines.
 *
 * It is written from the same arrays the pages themselves are built from, so a
 * new comparison page or a new article is in here the moment it exists. A
 * hand-kept list would fall behind on the first busy day and nobody would
 * notice, because nothing on the site looks broken when a page is missing from
 * the sitemap — it just never gets read.
 *
 * Deliberately absent: /studio and /signin, which are a creator's own account
 * and carry noindex already; and creator store pages, which are listed by
 * their own owners rather than by us. The demo store is the one store that is
 * ours (lib/house-store.ts), so it is listed, at the address stores have.
