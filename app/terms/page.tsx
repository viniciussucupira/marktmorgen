        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the
        websites, products, and subscription services operated by Solrenning
        under the name Marktmorgen (“Marktmorgen,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). They
        cover this website and the Marktmorgen creator store (collectively,
        the “Services”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Solrenning is an independent software studio. We sell software to
        customers worldwide. By creating an account, purchasing a subscription,
        or otherwise using the Services, you agree to these Terms. If you do
        not agree, do not use the Services.
      </p>

      <LegalSection title="1. Eligibility and accounts">
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your
          jurisdiction if that is higher, to use the Services. By using the Services, you confirm
          that you meet this requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for providing accurate account information and for
          keeping your email inbox and any passkeys you add secure, since they
          are how you sign in. You are also responsible
          for all activity that occurs under your account. Notify us promptly at{" "}

          One account may run up to five stores. Each store is a subscription
          of its own; the free trial applies to an account&apos;s first store
          only. The owner of a store may invite up to five people to its team.
          Team members sign in with their own email address and act on the
          owner&apos;s behalf, within the role the owner gives them: what they
          do in the studio is done for the owner, and the owner remains
          responsible for the store and for what the team does in it under
          these Terms. Only the owner pays for the store, connects its Stripe
          account, manages its team and deletes it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or that
          we reasonably believe pose a risk to the Services, other users, or
          our operations.

        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">The Marktmorgen creator store.</strong> A
          hosted store page where a creator sells digital files, courses,
          memberships and calls, and can run a community for their buyers and
          an affiliate program. The buyer pays into the creator&apos;s own connected Stripe
          account, and the file is delivered as soon as the payment clears.
          {feeWords().termsCharge}
        </p>
        <p>
          Creator stores are open. Taking a store address, building the page and
          connecting a Stripe account are free. Taking a card on that page
          requires a paid subscription, which, on an account&apos;s first
          store, begins with a free trial of 14 days, and which renews every month or every year, whichever you chose,
          at the price shown on the home page until it is canceled. The price
          and the payment provider are shown before any card is asked for, and
          these Terms apply to that subscription. We email you at least seven
          days before the first charge after the trial, and, on a yearly
          subscription, between 15 and 45 days before each renewal, with the
          date, the amount and how to cancel.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may update, improve, or discontinue features. When practical, we
          will provide reasonable notice of material changes. Except for a
          creator store used as described in section 3, the Services are
          provided for your personal or internal business use. You may not
          resell, sublicense, or offer the Services to third parties as your
          own product without our prior written permission.

      <LegalSection title="3. Selling through a Marktmorgen store">
        <p>
          This section applies if you use Marktmorgen to sell to your own buyers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">You are the seller.</strong> Each sale
          made through your store is a contract between you and your buyer.
          Marktmorgen is not a party to it, is not the merchant of record for
          it, and does not sell your products to anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">The money is never ours.</strong>{" "}
          Payments are made into your own Stripe account through Stripe direct
          charges. {feeWords().termsMoney}
          Payouts follow the schedule and settings of your own Stripe account,
          and your relationship with Stripe is governed by your agreement with
          Stripe, not by these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">What you are responsible for.</strong>{" "}
          The product you sell and its description and price; having the rights
          to everything you upload and sell; answering your own buyers;
          refunds, disputes, and chargebacks on your own sales; and any tax you
          owe on your sales, including sales tax, VAT, or GST where it applies
          to you. If you run an affiliate program, paying your affiliates what
          you agreed is yours too: we keep the record, and we never hold or
          pay out that money. That includes pay per lead: what counts as a
          lead, its amount, hold, caps and budget are yours to set, approving
          or reversing each lead is your decision, and you must not use it to
          pay for sign-ups or bookings that people did not make themselves. If you run a community, what is posted in it is
          yours to moderate, and the rules in section 4 apply to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Payment requests.</strong> Send a
          payment request only to a person who agreed to pay you for what it
          lists, for what you are owed or agreed. It is not for marketing, for
          asking someone you have no dealings with, or for a sum they dispute.
          You are the seller of what it is for, and its refunds and disputes
          are yours, as for any sale. Nothing is added to what the person pays
          for paying by request: no fee, no interest and no late charge, and a
          request may not be used to add one. Each request and each reminder
          is one of your store&apos;s emails for the month. We may switch
          payment requests off for a store that misuses them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Reviews.</strong> Reviews on your
          store come only from buyers whose payment your Stripe account
          confirms. You may answer a review and hide one. You may not offer
          anything in return for a review, or present as a review anything a
          buyer did not write. A hidden review still counts
          in your average, and your page says how many are hidden.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Services you choose to connect.</strong>{" "}
          If you connect an email platform (Mailchimp, Kit, beehiiv or
          MailerLite), your Google Calendar or, once it is offered, your Zoom
          account, or choose Jitsi Meet rooms or your own meeting link for
          your calls and live events, that is your choice. Those services are run by third parties under their own
          terms and privacy policies, your account with them is yours, and we
          are not responsible for what they do or for their availability.
          Send to an email platform only people who agreed to hear from you;
          the Services send only those who did. A meeting made on your Google
          or Zoom account is yours: it stays there if you disconnect, and
          what that service does with it is between you and them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">
            Ad pixels, and purchases sent to ad platforms.
          </strong>{" "}
          When you add a Meta, Google, TikTok or Pinterest pixel to your store,
          or give us an access token so that purchases, membership payments and
          sign-ups are also sent to that platform from our server, you are instructing us to send that data to
          that platform on your behalf, and you are responsible for doing so
          lawfully. That means telling your visitors and buyers about it in your
          own privacy notice, giving any notice or opt-out link the law where
          you or they are requires, and following that platform&apos;s own
          terms for its business tools, which you accept with that platform.
          The Services do their part: where the law asks for consent first
          (the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and
          Brazil, and any country we cannot tell) nothing is sent unless the
          visitor agrees; a browser that sends Global Privacy Control is never
          sent; a link at the foot of your pages changes the choice; and an
          email address is sent only hashed. Do not use these tools for a
          store aimed at children, or to send anything that reveals a
          person&apos;s health, beliefs or other sensitive matters. We may
          switch them off for a store that misuses them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">
            Your buyers&apos; addresses for ad audiences.
          </strong>{" "}
          The file of buyers for ad audiences holds the addresses of buyers who
          agreed to hear from you and have not left your list. Uploading it to
          an ad platform is your decision and yours to answer for: do it only
          where your buyers&apos; permission and your own privacy notice cover
          that use, which in some places means having asked for it in so many
          words, and follow that platform&apos;s terms for customer lists. We
          do not send the file anywhere ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Slack and Discord.</strong> When you
          give us a Slack or Discord webhook address, you ask us to post your
          store&apos;s weekly and monthly numbers there. Anyone who can read
          that channel reads them, so choose it as you would choose who gets
          the email; what that service does with them is between you and it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Questions your store asks.</strong>{" "}
          If you leave on the question after paying (&ldquo;where did you hear
          about us?&rdquo;), or turn on the question on your sales pages
          (&ldquo;is anything stopping you from buying?&rdquo;), the answers are
          counted for your numbers and kept with nothing that identifies the
          person who gave them. Use them to improve your store, not to contact
          or single out anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">
            Bringing a store from another platform.
          </strong>{" "}
          When you import contacts, you confirm, and are responsible for it
          being true, that every person in the file agreed to receive your
          emails, and that you may lawfully give us their details. When you
          import past buyers, you confirm that each person bought what the
          file says from you, that you have the right to give it to them
          here, and, if you ask us to email them, that you may tell them so.
          We check the file&apos;s format, not the truth of it, and we may
          switch off imports or email for a store that misuses them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">What you may not sell.</strong>{" "}
          Anything unlawful; anything that infringes someone else&apos;s rights;
          sexual content; anything that misleads your buyer about what they are
          paying for; anything that promises fast or easy money, or income for
          little effort; and anything that falls under the list of restricted
          businesses published by Stripe, since your payments run through
          Stripe.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Content sold with resale rights.</strong>{" "}
          You may sell content you did not make yourself, such as material
          sold with private label or resale rights, only under a license that
          lets you sell it the way you sell it here, and only when your product
          gives the buyer something to use beyond the right to sell it on. You
          keep that license and show it to us on request, and we may remove a
          product whose license you cannot show.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may remove a product or suspend a store that breaks this section.
          Doing so does not affect the money already in your own Stripe
          account.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same goes for the links on your page and anything played on it:
          link to, and play, only videos, music and podcasts that are yours or
          that their owner published on that service. When someone tells us
          that content on your store infringes their copyright or is illegal,
          we follow our{" "}

          : we may take the content down, we tell you and how to answer, and we
          switch off the pages and sales of a store that is the subject of
          repeated valid notices. Your buyers keep what they already bought
          for as long as the store is open (section 8).

          If you email your list through the Services, you also agree to write
          only to people who agreed to hear from you; never to import an
          address that was bought, rented, borrowed or collected without that
          agreement; to give a true postal address where you can be reached,
          which we print at the bottom of each email; to write subject lines that
          are not misleading; and to follow the laws on commercial email that
          apply to you and to your readers, including the CAN-SPAM Act in the
          United States. Every email carries an unsubscribe link that we honor
          permanently, and you may not ask anyone to do more than click it. An
          address that cannot be delivered to, or whose owner reports an email
          as spam, is taken off your list automatically and is not written to
          again. {healthRuleWords()}

        <p>
          If you use Outreach to write to a business, you are the sender of
          that email: it leaves from your own mailbox, under your own name. You
          agree to send it only to the business address the studio found for
          it, with the closing lines the studio adds left as they are; to send
          what you have read and stand behind, with nothing in it that is
          untrue; never to use it to write to a private person, or to a list;
          to stop writing to a business the moment it asks, and to record it
          in your studio; and to follow your mail provider&apos;s rules and the
          laws on commercial email that apply to you and to the business you
          write to. The studio refuses what it can tell is not allowed, but it
          is not legal advice, and what you send is yours to answer for.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may investigate suspected violations and take action, including
          pausing a send, switching off email for a store, or suspending or
          terminating your account.

          <strong className="text-black">Your billing month.</strong> A paid
          plan&apos;s monthly figures are counted in your billing month, not
          the calendar month: it begins on the day your plan renews and ends
          when the next payment&apos;s month begins, so each payment buys one
          month of every figure. A yearly plan&apos;s figures are monthly too,
          each month beginning on the day of the month your year began. A free
          trial&apos;s figures are counted for the trial as a whole, and a
          store with no plan, before one starts or after one ends, counts them
          by calendar month (UTC). Until we have read your plan&apos;s billing

          counts as {API_WRITE_UNITS}); store emails are the emails your
          store&apos;s own tools send outside your monthly emails and your
          orders (inbox notices and replies, a purchase sent again, reminders,
          offers, notices to members); access emails hand a buyer what they
          already have (a link to their purchases, a course, a private
          podcast, a place in a purchase made for several people); buyer
          actions are what your buyers, and you, do inside what was bought
          other than opening its pages (a community post, comment, like,
          message, RSVP or picture, a lesson comment, a hand-in, a lesson
          marked done, a certificate; what you do there yourself counts as
          studio requests, and deleting what one wrote is not counted); a
          webhook delivery is each try to send one of your webhooks,
          retries and tests included. When one is used, that use is refused with a plain
          message until your next billing month or a larger plan; nothing is
          billed past it. Changing your plan, canceling it, deleting your
          store and downloading your sales are never refused for it. Your
          store&apos;s public side also answers up to{" "}
          {countWords(REQUESTS_PER_VISIT)} requests for each visit its plan
          covers and a number more ({countWords(EXTRA_REQUESTS.creator)} on{" "}

          The {ASSISTANT_NAME} is an add-on, sold for one store at{" "}

          of its own, charged to the card your plan is paid with. It is sold

          of it holds {ASSISTANT_MESSAGES_MONTHLY.toLocaleString("en-US")} AI
          replies at the most each can cost; a reply that costs less gives the

          used, the chat becomes a form that leaves buyers&apos; questions for
          you until its next month begins; nothing more is charged. It answers
          only from what your store publishes and from the notes you write
          for it, labels every reply as written by AI, and may still be wrong:
          you are responsible for what your store publishes, which is what it
          repeats. It never offers a price, a discount or a term you did not
          publish, and its replies are not an offer or a contract on your
          behalf. You can stop it at any time; it stays on until the end of
          the month already paid. If your plan ends, it is set to stop at the
          end of the month already paid. Its payments are not refunded, except
          where applicable consumer law requires it. A disputed payment ends
          it at once, and it is not sold to that store again. A conversation
          with it is kept for {ASSISTANT_KEEP_SECONDS / 3_600} hours after its
          last message, without the buyer&apos;s name or address, and is sent
          to Anthropic&apos;s AI model to write the replies; see the Privacy

          to buyers who agreed at checkout to hear from you. It shows only
          products you list and sell, at the price and terms on their own

          after paying, and follows your own choices first (what goes well with

          collections). Only when you made none does an AI choose among your
          products, labeled as an AI suggestion; each such choice is one reply
          of the add-on&apos;s month, and once those are used your store&apos;s

          A visit is one person opening your store on one day, however many
          of its pages they look at. People are told apart by the network
          address they come from, and by nothing kept in their browser. You
          are never counted when you are signed in, and neither is a robot
          that says it is one. Your plan covers a number of visits in each
          billing month: {countWords(VISITS_INCLUDED.creator)} on{" "}
          {PLAN_TITLES.creator}, {countWords(VISITS_INCLUDED.pro)} on{" "}
          {PLAN_TITLES.pro}, and {countWords(VISITS_INCLUDED.scale)} on{" "}
          {PLAN_TITLES.scale}. Visits are not billed, and none are sold past
          that figure. Your store&apos;s public pages (its page, products,
          blog and collections, and the cards of the checkout script) rest
          once a month has had {(10_000 - BUYER_RESERVE_BPS) / 100}% of the
          figure; the last {BUYER_RESERVE_BPS / 100}% are kept for what your
          buyers already have (courses and lessons, the community and its
          live room, and private podcasts), which rest once the whole figure
          is used, with a page that tells your buyers their access is kept.
          Everything opens again with your next billing month, or when a plan
          change provides a larger figure. A checkout already open is never
          stopped by this. An unreadable count also pauses new public-page
          admission.
        </p>
        <p>
          A buyer who comes back is a visit like anybody else: a student or
          a member who opens a course or your community on a day is that
          day&apos;s visit, once. Two things a buyer&apos;s device does by
          itself are counted for what they cost. A subscriber to a private
          podcast is one visit on each day their podcast app checks for
          episodes, however often it checks. And your community&apos;s live
          room, which checks for new messages for as long as it is open in
          front of a member, counts for each member by the{" "}
          {ROOM_GRANT_MINUTES} minutes it is open: {partsWords(ROOM_LIVE_PARTS)}{" "}
          visits while people are talking, when it checks every few seconds,
          and {partsWords(ROOM_IDLE_PARTS)} of a visit while the room is
          quiet. A room in a background tab, or one nobody has touched for a
          while, checks nothing and counts nothing, and you are never
          counted in your own room.
        </p>
        <p>
          A store with no paid plan rests the same way until the plan is paid:{" "}
          {countWords(TRIAL_VISITS)} visits for the whole free trial, and{" "}
          {countWords(SETUP_VISITS)} a calendar month before a plan is started
          and after one has ended, until the month turns. A visitor to a resting store is
          told the page will be open again soon. Nothing is charged for
          visits, and downloads of what a buyer bought are not visits and are
          never part of the rest. The live room of a resting store
          stops checking by itself and shows new
          messages when a member asks for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Orders are counted the same way. An order is one purchase confirmed
          (a bundle or a cart of several products is one), one offer taken
          after paying, one PayPal order, one place in a purchase made for
          several people, or one free copy sent to an address, each counted
          once; a package of calls is one order, and a call booked counts as{" "}
          {countWords(CALL_ORDER_UNITS)}, for the emails and reminders it
          sends. Your plan covers a number of orders in each billing month:{" "}
          {countWords(ORDERS_INCLUDED.creator)} on {PLAN_TITLES.creator},{" "}
          {countWords(ORDERS_INCLUDED.pro)} on {PLAN_TITLES.pro}, and{" "}
          {countWords(ORDERS_INCLUDED.scale)} on {PLAN_TITLES.scale}. Orders
          are not billed, and none are sold past that figure: when a paid
          store reaches it, new orders pause until the next billing month or
          a plan change that provides a larger figure. A buyer who tries to
          buy then is told plainly that the store is not taking new orders
          right now, and nothing is charged. A checkout opened in the
          preceding day counts toward the figure until it is paid or closes,
          so a buyer who is already paying is never stopped and receives
          everything bought. You are emailed automatically the first time a
          month reaches the figure.
          {feeWords().ordersShared} In the free trial, new orders, paid and
          free copies together, pause once the store has had{" "}
          {countWords(TRIAL_ORDERS)} in the trial, until the plan is paid; a
          buyer who is already paying is never stopped.

          What we ask in return is that the Services are used to sell your own
          work to your own audience, and not as general file hosting, a
          content delivery network, a backup service, or a way to distribute
          very large files at a scale the subscription does not cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your store passes the download allowance in a month, our system
          emails you the next morning with your own figure in it. That notice
          is automatic: it does not wait for anybody here to notice, and it
          reaches you whether or not we are looking. Your studio shows the
          same number at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two things happen on their own, and neither touches a buyer. Free
          copies — files given away rather than bought — pause for the rest
          of the month once a store has sent out{" "}
          {bytesWords(FREE_PAUSE_ABOVE_BYTES)} in that month, and resume when
          the month turns; anything anyone has bought is unaffected. And new
          uploads stop once a store holds as much as it may:{" "}
          {storageWords(PAID_STORAGE_BYTES.creator)} on Store,{" "}
          {storageWords(PAID_STORAGE_BYTES.pro)} on Studio, and{" "}
          {storageWords(PAID_STORAGE_BYTES.scale)} on Scale. A free trial has
          the smaller of {storageWords(TRIAL_STORAGE_BYTES)} and its chosen
          plan&apos;s storage limit. The threshold is{" "}
          {storageWords(SETUP_STORAGE_BYTES)} for a store with no plan, before
          one is started or after one has ended. That asks you to remove
          something before adding more and changes nothing about what is
          already there or already sold. A store that holds more than its
          figure when its plan ends cannot add to it, and section 8 says how
          long it keeps what it holds. Files your students hand in have room
          of their own: {storageWords(TASK_ROOM_BYTES.creator)} on Store,{" "}
          {storageWords(TASK_ROOM_BYTES.pro)} on Studio and{" "}
          {storageWords(TASK_ROOM_BYTES.scale)} on Scale. Your community keeps
          up to {COMMUNITY_PICTURES.creator.toLocaleString("en-US")} pictures in its posts on Store,{" "}
          {COMMUNITY_PICTURES.pro.toLocaleString("en-US")} on Studio and{" "}
          {COMMUNITY_PICTURES.scale.toLocaleString("en-US")} on Scale; deleting a post
          with a picture makes room for another. Your store&apos;s words and
          records (products, pages, posts, courses, contacts, forms and their
          answers, and what each order keeps, counted at what it really
          writes) have a data room of{" "}
          {dataRoomListWords({ creator: "Store", pro: "Studio", scale: "Scale" })}{" "}
          ({dataWords(NON_PAYING_DATA_ROOM_BYTES.trial)} in a free trial). When it is full, what
          you or your buyers would add is refused with a plain message until
          something is deleted or the plan is larger; deleting is never
          refused, and an order already paid for is never refused: room for
          every checkout still open is held before it opens, so new checkouts
          pause when the room is close to full, as they do at the month&apos;s
          orders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond those, we may limit or suspend a store only if use far above
          the published allowances continues after that notice has been sent
          and you have had a reasonable time to answer, or where the use is
          plainly abusive or unlawful. We will not do it silently, and never
          in the middle of delivering something a buyer has already paid for.

          before that day stops it, and everything stays exactly as it was.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the closing day the files the store keeps are removed (the files
          its products hand over, its lessons&rsquo; videos and downloads, its
          podcast&rsquo;s episodes, the files its students handed in and the
          pictures in its community&rsquo;s posts), and the renewals of the
          memberships and payment plans sold through it are set to end on the
          creator&rsquo;s own Stripe account, each at the end of the period its
          buyer already paid for; any refund remains the creator&rsquo;s
          decision. Within {ERASE_WITHIN_DAYS} days, and usually the same day,
          everything else the store keeps with us is deleted: its page and
          settings, products and prices, pages, posts, courses and the
          certificates they gave, community, contacts, forms and their
          answers, numbers, and its buyers&rsquo; access to what they bought
          from it. Its address is held back from
          anyone else for {RELEASE_QUARANTINE_DAYS} days. Your account and sign-in stay until you
          delete them, and you may open a new store.

          <strong className="text-black">Download what you want to keep before that day.</strong>{" "}
          The studio offers your whole store as one file: while your plan
          runs, as often as your plan&rsquo;s studio use allows, and{" "}
          {ENDED_STORE_EXPORTS === 1 ? "once" : `${ENDED_STORE_EXPORTS} times`}{" "}
          after it ends, before the closing day, whatever the store&rsquo;s
          size. It holds your products and their pages, posts,
          courses with every lesson&rsquo;s text, forms and their answers,
          contacts and your orders as a spreadsheet. Files and videos
          download from their own pages. Your students can download their
          course certificates until the closing day, and not after.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">What we keep after a store closes.</strong>{" "}
          No copy of the store&rsquo;s sales. The store sells on your own
          Stripe account, which holds every sale, refund and payout and is
          yours to keep: those are your records as the seller. Our own
          records of the store are our invoices for its plan and any fee we
          charged, which stay in our billing records for as long as the law
          requires, and a note of the dates the store ended and closed, kept
          for about a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">If you bought from a creator&rsquo;s store.</strong>{" "}
          What you buy from a store is delivered through that store while it
          is open on Marktmorgen. When it closes, what was bought from it can
          no longer be downloaded or opened here, and renewals of what you
          subscribe to there stop at the end of the period you paid for. The
          creator is told {CLOSING_DAYS} days ahead and asked to give buyers
          another way to what they bought. Download the files and course
          certificates you want to keep before then. The store leaves your
          library on Marktmorgen when it closes; nothing else in it changes.
          A refund is a matter between you and the creator (section 9).

          A plan that ended before{" "}
          {new Date(KEEP_NOTHING_FROM).toLocaleDateString("en-US", { year: "numeric", month: "long", day: "numeric", timeZone: "UTC" })}{" "}
          keeps the rule it ended under: the store and its records stay; a
          store that keeps {storageWords(SETUP_STORAGE_BYTES)} or less of
          files and lesson videos is not affected, and one that keeps more has
          its files removed {CLOSING_DAYS} days after the plan ended, after the
          same three emails, which deleting enough to keep{" "}
          {storageWords(SETUP_STORAGE_BYTES)} or less before that day also
          stops.

            Refund Policy

          . In summary: your first payment to us is refunded in full on request
          within {REFUND_DAYS} days of it, for any reason or none; a yearly
          plan is refunded at any time for the months not yet started, the
          months used being charged at the monthly price and the card
          processing fee Stripe charged on that payment being kept; and you may cancel
          at any time, keeping access to the end of the period already paid for.
        </p>
        <p>
          A refund on something you bought from a creator&apos;s store is a
          matter between you and that creator, who received your money in their
          own Stripe account and sets their own refund terms.

          Marktmorgen and its licensors own all rights in the Services,

        <p>
          You retain ownership of what you submit to the Services (“User
          Content”) — the files, images, text and descriptions you upload to
          your store. You grant Marktmorgen a limited license to host, store
          and deliver User Content solely to provide the Services: to show your
          store page to the people you send there, and to hand a file to the
          buyer who paid you for it. We do not use your files or your store&apos;s
          text to train anything, and we do not sell or license them to anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          That license lasts as long as you keep the content on Marktmorgen. When you
          remove a product or close your store, it ends for the content removed.

          OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR THE
          SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US IN THE THREE (3)
          MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM AROSE, OR US$50, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. Money
          a buyer paid into a creator&apos;s own Stripe account was never paid
          to us and is not part of that amount.

          Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations. In those cases,
          our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

          You agree to indemnify and hold Marktmorgen harmless from claims
          arising out of your User Content, the products you sell through a

        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate your access if you breach these Terms, if
          required by law, or if we discontinue the Services. Upon termination,
          your right to use the Services ends. Sections that by their nature
          should survive — including intellectual property, disclaimers,
          limitation of liability, and governing law — will survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we suspend or close a store, we email its owner the reason
          and give them a chance to answer, unless the law, or an urgent risk
          to buyers, other users or the Services, requires us to act at once;
          in that case we email the reason as soon as we can. If we discontinue
          the Services, we give at least 30 days&apos; notice by email.
