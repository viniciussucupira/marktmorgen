/**
 * The Marktmorgen MCP server (added 11 October 2026): a creator's AI
 * assistant — Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, anything that speaks the Model Context
 * Protocol — can ask about their store in plain words: "which channel made me
 * money this month?", "what did my October reel bring?".
 *
 * Streamable HTTP, JSON only, one JSON-RPC message per request; a GET is
 * answered 405, because no stream is offered. The key is the same API key as
 * /api/v1, through the same door (lib/api-guard.ts) and the same limit per
 * minute; `initialize` alone is answered before the key is read, so a client
 * can learn what this is before it has been given anything, and that answer
 * carries no store's data.
 *
 * Read only: numbers, products, memberships, emails and affiliates, each as
 * the studio shows them (lib/mcp-tools.ts, added 12 October 2026, beside the
 * first three). Buyers', members', subscribers' and affiliates' addresses
 * and words stay out of it on purpose: an assistant's conversation is kept by
 * whoever runs the assistant, and the people on a creator's list never agreed
 * to be read there. The API is where a creator's own tools read those.
