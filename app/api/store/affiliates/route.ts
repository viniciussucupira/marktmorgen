/**
 * The creator running their affiliate programme, one action at a time:
 *
 * `{ action: "settings", enabled, percent, days, rule, payday, hold, rates: { <product>: 0-90 } }`,
 *   where `payday` is the day of the month they pay (1-28, or 0 for no promised
 *   day), `hold` is how many days a sale waits before it can be paid, and
 *   `rule` is "last" or "first": which of two links a buyer followed earns it,
 *   and `lifetime` keeps a buyer with the affiliate who brought them, for good;
 *   `idle` removes an approved affiliate with no sale and no lead for that
 *   many days (0, or 90 to 730), always after a warning (630 [HN6](3));
 *   `contacts` credits a sale nothing else credits to the affiliate whose
 *   confirmed lead the buyer is (lib/affiliate-leads.ts contactFor), only
 *   while the program pays per lead (creditsContacts);
 * `{ action: "code", promo, id }`, giving one of the creator's own discount
 *   codes to one affiliate so a sale that used it earns them their share with
 *   no click at all; an empty `id` takes the code back;
 * `{ action: "approve" | "decline" | "remove" | "restore", id }`;
 * `{ action: "payout", id, amount: "25.50", date: "2026-09-26", reference }`,
 *   which only writes down a payment the creator made themselves;
 * `{ action: "unpay", payout }`, to take back one written down by mistake;
 * `{ action: "rate", id, rate: 1-90 | null }`, a share for this affiliate
 *   alone, or back to the program's own shares;
 * `{ action: "share", id, percent, products: [<product>] }`, a standing share
 *   of every sale of those products — what Hotmart calls co-production — or
 *   `{ action: "share", id, percent: null }` to end it. Refused when
 *   everything promised on one product, affiliate commission included, would
 *   pass the cap in lib/partner-share.ts;
 * `{ action: "invite", email, percent, products }`, the same thing for
 *   somebody not in the programme at all: they are emailed the terms and the
 *   record is made, already approved, when they open the link — unless that
 *   address already has a store here, in which case the offer waits in their
 *   own studio instead of their inbox;
 * `{ action: "answer", invite, accept: true | false }`, that creator
 *   answering one. Only the address it was left for can answer it;
 * `lead: { kind, cents, hold, daily, budget }` on "settings", pay per lead
 *   (lib/affiliate-lead-rules.ts), refused when any number is out of range;
 * `{ action: "leads", ids: [<lead>], decision: "approve" | "reverse" | "reopen", why }`,
 *   the creator's decision on confirmed leads (lib/affiliate-leads.ts decideLeads).
