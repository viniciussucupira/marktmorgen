/**
 * POST /api/v1/hooks — adds a webhook endpoint from a tool, as the studio's
 * Webhooks page does: `{ "url": "https://…", "events": ["sale.completed"] }`.
 * The answer carries its id and its signing secret, this once. This is how
 * Zapier subscribes a Zap to the store (zapier/index.js).
 * DELETE /api/v1/hooks — removes one: `{ "id": "we_…" }`.
 *
 * A key that may write only: an endpoint is where buyers' names and
 * addresses can go, so a key made to read cannot add one, and every endpoint
 * added this way is reported to the creator, as one added in the studio is
 * (lib/account-notice.ts). The same five endpoints a store may have
 * (MAX_ENDPOINTS) count both.
