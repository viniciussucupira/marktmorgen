 * "v0:<x-zm-request-timestamp>:<body>" under ZOOM_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN)
 * from the last five minutes, or it is refused, the address check included,
 * so this address never signs anything for anybody else. Each signed notice
 * is acted on once: its signature is kept for ten minutes, longer than the
 * five it is accepted for, and the same one again is acknowledged and
 * ignored — so a notice captured and sent again cannot, say, disconnect an
 * account the creator connected again a minute after removing the app.
 *
 *   endpoint.url_validation   Zoom checking the address: answered with the
 *                             plain token and its HMAC, as Zoom asks.
 *   app_deauthorized          a Zoom user removed the app: every store that
 *                             user connected forgets the connection and its
 *                             tokens at once, and its owner is told.
 *
 * Anything else is acknowledged and ignored.
