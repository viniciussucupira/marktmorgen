/**
 * The daily run that writes to a creator who has gone past the allowance.
 *
 * Section 5 of the Terms promises that a store far above the published
 * limits is written to first, with the figures, and given time to answer,
 * before anything is limited. That promise was the last thing in this system
 * that needed a person: everything else — the pause on free downloads, the
 * brake on storage — acts by itself, while the letter sat waiting for
 * somebody to notice and write it.
 *
 * A promise that depends on somebody noticing is not a promise. So the
 * letter is sent from here, to the creator, by name, with their own number
 * in it, the morning after they cross. Nobody has to be watching, and the
 * clause in the Terms is kept by the machine that made it necessary.
 *
 * Once per store per calendar month. A store that is over stays over until
 * the counter rolls, and a mail every morning for three weeks is how a
 * notice stops being read.
 *
 * Nothing in here blocks or limits anything. It writes.
 *
 * It is also the run that bills the one thing charged by use: lesson video
 * watched past the hours a plan covers (lib/watch-billing.ts). Each store
 * past them has the hours added to its next invoice, by itself, and its
 * creator is written to the first time a month passes them: what they have
 * come to, and that nobody is cut off. A store with no plan to charge is
 * written to as well, because its videos are paused (lib/learn.ts).
 *
 * Visits and orders are not billed (since 17 October 2026, when their prices
 * past a plan no longer kept the owner's 60% after tax). Each creator is
 * written to once a month instead: when a month's visits rest the store's
 * public pages (lib/traffic-rules.ts), and when a paid store's orders reach
 * its plan's figure and new orders stop (lib/order-admission.ts).
