# TX2a — Separate annual profit and incoming exchange bases

Source check: 31 October 2026. Owner decisions: queue item 472, DR and AV8, including the 31 October IOF and IN RFB 1.037 article 2 VII corrections. This is a bounded arithmetic scenario, not completed TX2, a legal/commercial review, a registration or permission to sell.

## Implemented arithmetic

`MOST_CORRECT_READING` describes the requested scenario: IRPF 15%, revenue tax 0%, buyer tax outside the price up to 27% where legally due, and a separate incoming-exchange IOF rate of 0.38%. Its zero revenue-tax coefficient is scenario metadata, not evidence that every tax is inapplicable to the real business. Consumption classification, state income/franchise nexus, registrations, actual facts and other country taxes still require their own complete evidence.

`mostCorrectTaxesOf` accepts annual accounting profit and a complete explicit list of incoming exchange operations. Both bases must already be BRL cents; unknown currency/conversion, profit or exchange coverage returns null. An explicit empty exchange list represents no entry; it never removes annual IRPF. A distribution of profit already taxed is not another annual profit, but its exchange operation still belongs in the incoming list. Annual losses create no credit here against IOF. Prior-year loss compensation, credits and real return preparation are outside this calculator.

IRPF is rounded upward to a whole cent. IOF is rounded upward for each separately supplied operation, then summed with exact integer arithmetic; these are conservative modeled ceilings, not actual payment instructions or a claim about a bank's final assessment. Unsafe amounts, sparse/inherited entries, accessors and unreadable evidence refuse. No exchange rate or entry amount is inferred from annual profit, including no assumption that IRPF is paid before remitting profit.

Example: BRL10,000 annual profit with no entry has modeled IRPF BRL1,500 and IOF0. An explicit BRL5,000 entry gives IOF BRL19. An explicit entry of the entire BRL10,000 gives IOF BRL38, in addition to the annual IRPF. None of these modeled amounts certifies real accounts or excludes other applicable taxes.

Changed LLC facts require a new classification; this calculator does not authenticate real company records.

## Binding controls preserved

The binding gate remains `MOST_TAX_READING`:78.18% profit,5% revenue,27% VAT inside; the27.5% stress/sizing floor remains. The new scenario is excluded from `READINGS`; existing `taxOf`, `unitUnder`, cost budgets and every generated report remain unchanged. Passing its metadata to the existing unit model still retains that model's stress floor. Use the separate-base function only for this explicit scenario; it never authorizes a lower operational reserve.

No new state-tax threshold automation, real review, actual accounting, vendor quote or financial certification is supplied. All unknown costs/taxes continue to refuse admission. Consultation records remain empty, EU hosting false, commercial review null, sales/opening flags false. Existing receiving fees, remittance allowance, reserves, prices, visible limits, rights, content and Hazelsong remain intact.

## Costs and verification

No productive network call, command, key, stored record, paid service or dependency is added. Incremental productive monthly/annual cost: Store0/0,Studio0/0,Scale0/0 in each interval, because this is local pure arithmetic only. Existing costs and paid research/CI/hosting invoices remain unknown, never zero, allocated100%to Marktmorgen/FX275; no cost ceiling, funded reserve or entitlement is lowered.

Synthetic tests cover retained profit, partial/full entry, previously taxed distributions, losses with entries, per-operation rounding, safe-integer limits, currency and unknown evidence, non-executed accessors, and preservation of the binding gate/floors/flags/reviews. Hosted complete-suite39+Vercel verification is required on the PR head; no local tests or real financial actions are used. A green result is code verification only.
