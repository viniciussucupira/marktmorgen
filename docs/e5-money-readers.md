# Who reads the store's currency (22 [E5], unit 2a)

Inventory written by Claude 2 on 2 November 2026, from the code on main, for the design in [buyer-currency-and-language.md](buyer-currency-and-language.md) ("The money everywhere else" and unit 2). Nothing changes in the code by this document; `tests/e5-money-readers.test.ts` fails when a file that reads the store's currency is missing here, or listed and no longer reads it.

A store can already change its currency (`app/api/store/currency/route.ts`), so a store may hold sales, subscriptions, payment requests and agreements in a currency other than its current one today, before any product is priced in several currencies. The findings below are therefore real now, not only after E5.

## The classes

- **SETTING**: shows or edits the store's own currency, or its prices and limits. Stays on the store's currency; unit 3 decides what the store page says when checkout may charge another.
- **NEW-CHARGE**: makes a new charge, Price, coupon or shipping rate in the store's currency. Unit 3.
- **PAST-SALE**: shows an amount from a past sale, refund, invoice or subscription. Must use that record's own currency (unit 2).
- **FOLLOW-UP-CHARGE**: charges again after a first sale (the offer after paying, subscription switches). Must use the order's or the subscription's currency, or refuse plainly (unit 2).
- **TOTALS**: adds amounts across sales. Must total per currency, never converted, and say what is in another currency (unit 2).
- **OTHER**: reads the currency for something that is not money.

The grep (`store.currency`, `current.currency`, a name ending in `s.currency`) also catches names like `ours.currency` or `props.currency`; each file is classed by what it actually does, under its most demanding use. Readers that get the currency under another name, or through `speech(store).money` (`lib/buyer-words`), are not in this list; unit 2 follows them from the classes below.

## What unit 2 must fix first

Unit 2b fixed 1, 2 and 5, unit 2c fixed 3 and 6, units 2d and 2e fixed 4 and 2f checked the rest of it, and 2d checked 7 (marked below). Nothing on this list is left before unit 3.

1. **Fixed in unit 2b.** **The tier switch had no currency check.** `lib/tier-switch.ts` makes the new tier's Price in the store's currency (lines 94 and 135) and never compares it with the subscription's. The offer after paying, the yearly switch and the yearly ask all refuse a mismatch; the tier switch does not, so for a member who subscribed before the store changed its currency, it asks Stripe to move the subscription onto a Price in another currency. What Stripe then does has not been tried here.
2. **Fixed in unit 2b** (counted and said on the numbers page). **Refunds and disputes in another currency vanished from the numbers.** `lib/stats.ts` puts sales in another currency in "elsewhere", but drops refunds and disputes in another currency without counting them (lines 1489–1535).
3. **Fixed in unit 2c** (the order, date and channel count; the money stays in the store's currency only, and the email studio says so). **A buyer whose sales were all in another currency was missing from segments.** `lib/segments.ts:79` left them out of the buyer ledger entirely: orders, last purchase and channel, not just the money.
4. **Totals that drop another currency with no "elsewhere".** Fixed in unit 2d for email revenue (each email and sequence counts its sales in another currency apart and says so; the MCP emails tool gives `sales_in_another_currency`) and subject tests (a test by sales counts a sale in any currency, adding no amount). Fixed in unit 2e for payment recovery (a renewal recovered in another currency is counted and said under the figures) and member health (each member's monthly amount in its own currency in the table, where another currency showed $0; members at risk in another currency counted beside "Revenue at risk", never added). Checked in unit 2f, with no change: the discount table is on the numbers page, under the sentence that already says how many sales in another currency are left out of those numbers; the A/B tests only meet another currency when a checkout opened before the store changed its currency is paid after it (a checkout session lasts at most a day), and then leave that sale out of the test; "how did you hear" takes an answer up to 30 days after paying, so a sale paid in the old currency and answered after the change counts as an answer with no money, on the same numbers page as that sentence. Nothing else of item 4 is left until unit 3 lets a buyer pay in another currency on purpose, when these three must count those sales apart too.
5. **Fixed in unit 2b.** **Past amounts labelled with the store's currency:** the phone alert for a booked call (`lib/calls.ts:1341`) and the bookings API (`lib/api-read.ts:189`).
6. **Fixed in unit 2c** for payment requests: the studio list shows each request in its own currency. Agreements too: their list shows no amount, and a new version started from an older one in another currency now leaves its amounts empty and says to type them again in the store's currency, instead of reading €50 as $50.

7. **Checked in unit 2d, not a defect: a paid call's orders and affiliate lead.** `countOrder` only asks whether anything was paid (`coveredByShare`), and the lead's `paid` is only compared with the refunds of the same payment, which are in its own currency; the lead's bounty is the creator's terms, in the store's currency. No amount is added across currencies there.
