The owner authorized a calculated minimum paid customer base and separately funded acquisition/refund exposure. A free account has no positive revenue on which a 60% profit margin could be computed. It is never reported as a profitable paid customer.

Commercial review now separates nine revenue-bearing scenarios (six fixed plan/cycle offers and three overage cases) from seven funded exposure scopes: trial, setup, full refunds, non-payment, post-cancellation, paused accounts and accrued legacy credits. Every scope requires explicit maximum occurrences in the worst recognized month and complete per-occurrence cost/tax ceilings, even when the reviewed occurrence cap is zero. Expected conversions, future invoices and another scope's profit cannot offset losses. Full refunds preserve non-refundable card fees, taxes and service costs.

Every funded trial, setup and ended AI allocation must also appear in the corresponding exposure occurrence cap and full per-case AI cost. Those pools cannot disappear from the company accounting even when paid customer AI is covered.

The sum of all simultaneous losses must fit the reviewed monthly exposure ceiling. The entire ceiling is then added to the company fixed-cost ceiling before calculating the minimum paid base, with no assumed tax deduction. Each paying customer's surplus above 60% funds its equal allocation of this total. The weakest of all six plan/cycle cases determines the base, using exact annual normalization. A base of one is accepted only if that customer's own surplus covers the full allocation. A base below the computed minimum cannot approve commercial release.

The former demand that every free/refund case independently earn 60%, and that one customer always carry all company fixed expenses, is replaced by this explicitly authorized allocation. The 60% test on paid customer units is unchanged. Reviews bind these rules in the price-and-rights snapshot. Missing, expired, underfunded, unbounded or incomplete exposure reviews keep release closed.

This is a review calculation, not a live enrollment ledger. Actual acquisition occurrence limits, reserve availability, active paid-base observation, retention risk, legacy obligations and supplier enforcement still need runtime admission controls and evidence. Existing refund rights or accrued credits may not be denied to fit a new budget. New exposure must stop before exceeding a reviewed allocation; old obligations require sufficient reserves. The actual commercial review and the exposure policy remain null (the AI and upload policies are computed in code for paid plans only, docs/automatic-spend-policies.md), so this change does not authorize sales, certify tax rates or establish the real minimum customer count.

The first runtime integration is now the persistent exposure reservation before non-paying AI dispatch; see [exposure admission](exposure-admission.md).

Since 17 October 2026, under the owner's decision "Teto mínimo pago pela empresa" (AGENTS.md), every store that pays nothing (a free trial, no plan, an ended plan) must hold one of the calendar month's shared places before its studio, its public pages and requests, its orders and free copies or its emails cost anything (lib/free-pool.ts). The places are `FREE_POOL_BASE_STORES` (10) plus one for every `PAID_STORES_PER_FREE_STORE` (40) paying stores (lib/free-pool-rules.ts). Each such store has small figures of its own: a free trial counts its figures for the trial as a whole (1,000 visits, 100 orders paid and free together, 300 list emails on a trial of a plan with them, and the studio, API and email figures of `NON_PAYING_ALLOWANCES`), and a store with no plan or an ended one counts smaller ones by calendar month. tests/plan-cost-registry.ts works out the worst window one of them can cost (`nonPayingWorst`, about $1.36 at today's rates) and puts 1/40 of it into every paying plan's worst month (line free-share), held with the rest to the owner's 60%. The ten base places are a company fixed cost of at most ten times that worst window a month, covered by the minimum paid base. Files an ended store keeps were, until 18 October 2026, kept up to a store with no plan's room with no date: storage with no use behind it, for ever. Since that day a plan that ends keeps nothing past its closing day (`lib/plan-closing-rules.ts`, `keptRoomFor`; the same notices and checks as before), and what it keeps until then is priced once per payment in the payment's own worst case (`tests/plan-cost-registry.ts`, `PER_PAYMENT_LINES`, `retained-files`), so it is no longer an open exposure. A plan that ended before that day keeps the old rule; plans could not yet be bought then (lib/commercial-margin.ts is closed), so this legacy exposure is at most the owner's own test stores, and any such store must still be counted here before release. This does not implement the remaining enrollment, reserve migration, other-provider or annual-term controls.

## What a store keeps in the database after its closing day

Since 18 October 2026 every store has a data room in the database (`lib/store-data-rules.ts`, `DATA_ROOM_BYTES`): what it keeps and what its orders leave is counted where it is written (an order at what each of its writes really adds, `lib/order-data.ts`, docs/order-data.md) and refused past the room, and every record kept outside the room is bounded in `tests/store-data-registry.ts`, which fails for a new key family that does not say how. `tests/plan-cost-registry.ts` prices the room full and the records outside it in every paying plan's worst month (line `database-storage`), and once more for the closing days after a plan ends (`PER_PAYMENT_LINES`, `retained-data`). A store that pays nothing has a small room of its own (`NON_PAYING_DATA_ROOM_BYTES`), priced in its worst window (`nonPayingWorst`).

Both exposures of the database after a plan ends are closed:

- **After the closing day: closed (18 October 2026), and priced per customer.** A plan that ends from 18 October 2026 closes the whole store on its closing day, whether it keeps files or not (`lib/plan-closing-rules.ts`, `closesStore`): the same three notices, the same week after the last and the same check with Stripe, and then that day its memberships' renewals are stopped on the creator's Stripe account, its PDFs' previews are deleted, its files go, and within the hour the walk (`lib/closed-store-data.ts`, `app/api/cron/closed-data`) deletes every record it keeps in the database, family by family as `CLOSING` in `lib/data-families.ts` declares for every family of `tests/store-data-registry.ts` (`tests/closing-families.test.ts` fails for a family that declares nothing). Nothing of its sales is copied anywhere: Marktmorgen is not the seller of record, every sale, refund and payout is on the creator's own Stripe account, and Marktmorgen's own records are its invoices and fees on its own Stripe account (question 13 of docs/tax-uncertainty.md). What is left: the company's declared records (the closing job's dates for 400 days, the store's addresses held back 30 days); keys that name no store, such as what a sale left under its own reference, gone by themselves within the days `CLOSING` declares (430 at the most); and the store's id in a person's records across stores (a buyer's library, the lists they joined, an affiliate's hub), never shown once the store is gone and run out by the quarter it was written in, 39 months at the most after its last quarter (`lib/joined-stores.ts`). `tests/closing-journey.ts` closes a store with a key in every family against a real Redis (`scripts/test_closed_store_redis.py`) and the in-memory one, with an in-memory file store.

  The owner's rule is per customer, and a closing is part of one customer's life, so its worst cost is in that customer's own margin, not the company's: `tests/plan-cost-registry.ts` prices it once for each store in `PER_PAYMENT_LINES` (`closure`), which `tests/spend-floor.test.ts` adds to every payment, so a store that paid one month and closed carries all of it, and every plan keeps 60% with its buffer by the month and by the year. Its parts, each at the ceilings the code holds by itself:

  | Plan | Its deletes | What its followers read | Its whole export after its plan ended | Its last steps | Once for the store |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | Store | $0.0018 | $0.0018 | $0.0037 | $0.0015 | $0.0087 |
  | Studio | $0.0056 | $0.0085 | $0.0080 | $0.0015 | $0.0236 |
  | Scale | $0.0106 | $0.0155 | $0.0123 | $0.0015 | $0.0398 |

  Taking one's data away is a right: once a plan has ended, the store has `ENDED_STORE_EXPORTS` (1) whole export of its own before it closes, counted for the store (app/api/store/export), never taken from a studio figure or the share of stores that pay nothing, so never refused for want of room or a place, and priced above at the largest store there can be (its room and record, every product, course, lesson, post and form there can be, read together, and its sales' pages at Stripe, the two lists side by side). What an order leaves for its store's closing is priced with the order (`ORDER_COST`): its buyers' library entries for their whole life, and its share of stopping a renewal at Stripe, 25 at a time. The store's id left in a person's records that the registry already counts as the company's (the lists they joined, an affiliate's hub) is the company's as those records are, now bounded: it runs out with the quarter it was written in. A free trial's store closes the same way, $0.0084 at the most, in the share of stores that pay nothing (`nonPayingWorst`). To make room, the closing's costly parts were made cheap (nobody's library walked buyer by buyer, deletes 4,000 keys a command, followers and the export reading a hundred to a thousand records a command), what a store writes after its plan ends is bounded by an ended store's own figures, and `retained-data` no longer counts again what a unit writes and lets go by itself, because each window's share of `database-storage` already pays for its whole life (`lifetimeByteMonths`, held for every part). With all of it, the room over the floor is $0.2504 for Store by the month, $1.0124 for Studio and $1.0096 for Scale by the year, each above its buffer ($0.25 and $1), and no price changed. The walk itself, reading the whole database, is the company's scheduled job: once a day at the most, for every store due since the last, at about $0.0044 a walk for every million keys ($0.14 a month for every million keys at one walk a day), and its hourly check is two commands when nothing is due.
- **Data kept before 18 October 2026: closed by the one-time count.** A store's records written before the room was counted were counted only as they were next written or moved. `lib/data-recount.ts` (`app/api/cron/recount`, hourly until done) measures every key of a family the room counts, finds its store by the ids that name it, and sets the store's room slot `legacy` to what was measured beyond what the room counts, so every room is at least as full as what its store keeps. Bounded per run, resumable and idempotent (docs/order-data.md). Release should wait until it reports done. Keys that name no store (a mark under a payment's id, an address's library across stores) are not anyone's room and stay bounded by their own entries in `tests/store-data-registry.ts`.

The database is priced as one region. A read region added in Upstash keeps a copy of everything and is billed for it: it multiplies the `database-storage` and `retained-data` lines by the number of copies, and must be priced before it is turned on. `tests/upstash-single-region.test.ts` fails if the code or the deployment ever configures one; switching one on in Upstash's console is the owner's act, and must wait for that price.

Moving orders older than 90 days to R2 was asked for and is not built: docs/order-data.md ("Asked for, and not built here") says why, with the measured sizes, for the owner's decision. Deleting a closed store's records at its closing day is built (above); keeping its sales in R2 for 7 years was built and taken out the same day, because they are the creator's records, not Marktmorgen's.

## EC1 — A closing store fair to its buyers: post-cancellation exposure (queue item 307, 30 October 2026)

Queue item 307 [EC1] (owner's request of 23/10/2026, 15h58 Fortaleza, and its complement of 30/10/2026, 13h12) adds to every closing of a store whose plan ended from 31 October 2026 (`BUYER_NOTICE_FROM`): its members held from the plan's end (Stripe pause of collection, invoices voided, `lib/closing-holds.ts`), one service email to each of its buyers at least 7 days before the closing and one follow-up ("the store stays" or "your refund could not be made", `lib/closing-buyers.ts`), and its members' unused time refunded from the creator's own Stripe account (`lib/closing-refunds.ts`). The refunds are the creator's money on the creator's account, never Marktmorgen's: each is made only when the account's available balance, read first, covers it.

What Marktmorgen pays for it is bounded per closing, before any of it is spent: the closing's emails are set once, when its members are held, at `EMAILS_PER_BUYER_PER_ENDING` (2) for each buyer `buyerNoticeCap` allows (`BUYER_CAP_MONTHS` = 24 months of the plan's orders; a free trial's 100 orders for a store that never paid), and every email is taken from them first (`lib/closing-credit.ts`). Each buyer at its cap is costed at `CLOSING_BUYER_COST` (tests/plan-cost-registry.ts): two emails at the dearer provider's $0.0009, its address and a member's last payment kept for the closing days, its share of a page of the store's own payments (found by Stripe's search on their metadata, at most `buyerPagesCap` pages a closing: past it the rest are counted as not told), and `STRIPE_CALLS_PER_MEMBER` (8) calls to the creator's Stripe account, each held two seconds at 2 GB. The calls are capped like the emails: when the closing starts, its call budget is set to `STRIPE_CALLS_PER_MEMBER` for each buyer the cap allows (`startCallBudget`, `lib/closing-holds.ts`), and every call for a member (listing its open and draft invoices, voiding them or keeping drafts as drafts and letting them go on a release, reading its paid invoices, its hold, its release, a retry, and its refund: the payment, the refunds made and the refund) is taken from it before it is made (`takeCalls`). The three calls of a member's refund are set aside when it is held (`REFUND_CALLS_PER_MEMBER`, "rcalls"), so the holds' daily retries can never spend them; a later try of a refund the balance did not cover takes from the rest of the budget. On the closing day a refund the budget cannot cover is told to its member like one the balance did not cover. A member past the budget is not held and is counted for the creator in every notice and in the studio. Each membership's end on the closing day is not in this budget: it is the one its order already pays for (`ORDER_RENEWAL_STOP` in `ORDER_COST`), and it is never refused, so no member is charged after the closing. One closing at its cap (`closingBuyersCost`):

| Plan that ended | Buyers at the cap | Ceiling of one closing |
|---|---|---|
| Store | 4,800 | $9.15 |
| Studio | 10,800 | $20.60 |
| Scale | 36,000 | $68.65 |
| A store that never paid | 100 | $0.19 |

**Why it is here and not in the closure line.** The item asked for it in the closure line (`PER_PAYMENT_LINES`). Priced there, at the price list of 18 October 2026 Store's monthly unit no longer keeps the historical 60% sizing floor that tests/limits-proposal.test.ts, tests/pricing-optimization.test.ts and tests/pricing-usage-proposal.test.ts hold (they propose cutting Store's visible figures for a few cents a month), and no test may be relaxed. So it is carried as the company's post-cancellation exposure, one occurrence per closing (a closing follows at least a payment or a trial), at the ceilings above; the exposure review stays null and release stays closed, as before. Whether to move it into the closure line (with a price change) or lower the cap is in "Depende do dono" of docs/codex-queue.md, item 307. Buyers past the cap are not written to by Marktmorgen and are counted for the creator in every notice and in the studio, so nothing is silent; while the cap is what it is, a store with more distinct buyers than its cap is the one case the checkout's sentence does not cover in full.

No company postal address exists yet (`lib/company-postal.ts`, empty): until it does, no buyer is emailed, and a store whose buyers must be told does not close (its retention continues inside the existing closing-days exposure). This is a release condition, not a cost.

**A plan paid for a store already closing (queue item 307 [EC1], with item 569 [NC1]).** From the start of its closing day a store refuses a plan checkout, but one opened before can still be finished on it. That plan is ended at once and its payment refunded in full from Marktmorgen's own Stripe account (`lib/closing-plan-guard.ts`): it is the money the creator paid us, given back, so the refund itself is not a cost, but the receiving cost of that one payment (`lib/receiving-costs.ts`, the dearer provider's fee on the amount charged) is not given back by Stripe on a refund and is the company's. It is a full-refund occurrence of this review, never offset by another scope. Occurrences are kept rare by code, not counted: the store's open plan checkouts are expired when the day starts (`expirePlanCheckouts`), a checkout lasts a day at most, and a new one is refused from then until the store's records are gone. There is no occurrence cap of its own yet ("Depende do dono" (d) of item 307), so, like every scope here, the exposure review stays null and release stays closed.

## LE448 — exposição própria da lista de pré-abertura (em implementação)

Pedido do dono26/10/2026 00h19Fortaleza. A lista da plataforma não é uma loja
fictícia, uma assinatura paga ou conversão futura. O escopo canônico
`platform_waitlist` passa a integrar a mesma revisão de exposição, o mesmo teto
de caixa e o mesmo ledger `nl:exposure:v1:YYYY-MM`; não cria um ledger paralelo,
não reinicializa saldo/slots nem usa uma loja inventada sob `setup`.
Revisão antiga sem esse caso é desconhecida e reprovada; interesse não pode entrar
como receita no caso. Tetos nulos, custos/impostos desconhecidos e ausência de
enforcement continuam reprovando. Nenhuma política atual deixa de ser nula.

O escopo tem slots/recibos próprios, preservando os recibos e obrigações dos demais
escopos. A reserva é permanente para a identidade/escopo/mês aprovada; repetir uma
operação não cria dinheiro ou slots. Faltando campo no ledger, a operação recusa
sem inicializá-lo. Configurar slots não autoriza enviar e-mail: ainda são
necessários o protocolo completo de consentimento, limites diários/mensais por
operação e o binding da unidade financiada à identidade/coorte real.

Antes de admissão, a revisão deve abranger inscrição, validação de e-mail,
confirmação, saída, consentimento exato/datatado, dados opcionais, retenção,
consultas/recusas/repetições, resumo semanal privado/CSV, armazenamento/transferência,
e-mail de abertura e novidades separadamente consentidas. Quantidade máxima de
casos, custo completo por caso e reserva são desconhecidos; não se publica aqui
um orçamento zero, uma base mínima ou margem aprovada. O teto por operação é
adicional à reserva de exposição, não substituído por ela.

### LE448 — núcleo compartilhado de tokens e isolamento de finalidade

A geração de tokens48hex, o identificadorRedis `nl:wl:t:sha256(token)` e o decoder
de grants de loja são extraídos para `lib/waitlist-tokens.ts`; a lista existente
importa esse núcleo e reexporta WAIT_TOKEN. Tokens/URLs/keys de lojas, seus
vencimentos, consentimento e dados permanecem compatíveis com grants legados
produzidos pelo código. A extração não cria lista, conta, e-mail, armazenamento,
cadastro ou boletim duplicado e não emite token de plataforma em produção.

Grants de plataforma possuem discriminador/versionamento próprio, finalidade
confirm/leave, identidade opaca de entrada e geração (para futura comparação CAS
no registro), emissão e vencimento absolutos. O decoder de loja recusa grants
com escopo de plataforma; o decoder de plataforma não aceita grants de loja,
finalidade trocada, geração/identidade inválida, dados excessivos, relógio
inválido, emissão futura, vencimento ou vida maior que confirm7dias/leave365dias
já usados pelo mecanismo. Só devolve dados de roteamento, sem e-mail/país/plano
ou afirmações de consentimento/autorização. A identidade hash não é anonimização
dos dados privados: futuras leituras continuam exclusivas ao fluxo autorizado.

Validar um grant não consome token, confirma inscrição nem autoriza despesa.
Comparação atômica da geração no registro e confirmação/saída/reentrada/outbox,
registro do consentimento exato/datatado, orçamento, políticas de retenção,
remetentes sintéticos, UI e resumo/CSV privado ainda estão pendentes no protocolo
integral LE448. Não se afirma que geração antiga já seja recusada contra uma
base que este incremento não cria. Testes novos cobrem compatibilidade, separação
entre listas/finalidades, tempo e dados indevidos; testes existentes de waitlist
também devem passar no CI completo do novo head. Nenhuma execução local ou
operação real; sem novo fornecedor/custo variável de operação, incremento real
deCI desconhecido e sem redução de tetosFX275. Sem entrega funcional adicional.
