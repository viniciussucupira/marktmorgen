# 414 [KX1] — Renewal, price and trial notices, cancellation and consent proof: legal matrix and code audit (30 Oct 2026)

Part 1 of queue item 414 [KX1]. **Research, not legal advice.** Nothing here
says that Marktmorgen, a creator or a store complies with any law. No code,
price, limit, commission, flag or gate changes in this PR; `PLANS_ON_SALE` and
`OPENING_REQUESTED` stay false. Implementation follows in later PRs, in the
order of section 4.

Main read: `c98eb4e281413ebe5811fb9cbfdb423639a59ea7`.

## 1. Sources read on 30 Oct 2026, and their standing

The build environment could not open the official pages
(leginfo.legislature.ca.gov, eur-lex.europa.eu, legislation.gov.uk) on this
day: the fetch was refused before it reached them. Where an official text was
not read, the row says **secondary** and the point stays at the **more
protective reading** until the official text is read and recorded. A
secondary source is never treated as the law (TX rule: unknown does not pass).

| # | Rule | What was read | Standing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1 | US federal: Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act, 15 U.S.C. §8403 | US Code 2023 edition on govinfo.gov (official) | **Official, read.** |
| S2 | FTC Negative Option Rule ("click to cancel", 16 CFR Part 425 as amended 2024) | Latham & Watkins client alert of 11 Jul 2025 on *Custom Communications, Inc. v. FTC*, No. 24-3137 (8th Cir., 8 Jul 2025) | **Secondary.** Reports the amended rule vacated in its entirety. The FTC docket and any later rulemaking were not read. |
| S3 | California Automatic Renewal Law, Bus. & Prof. Code §17602 | california.public.law mirror, page marked "Verified: Oct. 26, 2026" (its source dates disagree) | **Secondary (unofficial mirror).** To be read on leginfo. |
| S4 | EU withdrawal function, Directive (EU) 2023/2673 inserting Art. 11a into Directive 2011/83/EU | Van Bael & Bellis note of 8 Jun 2026 | **Secondary.** Applies from 19 Jun 2026; EUR-Lex text not read. |
| S6 | Utah (from 1 Jan 2025), Minnesota (from 1 Jan 2025), Massachusetts 940 CMR 38.05 (from 2 Sep 2025) | Kelley Drye "Auto-renewal laws: 2025 round-up", 31 Mar 2025 | **Secondary.** Reported: Utah, notice 30–60 days before a renewal of a term over 45 days and 3 days before a trial ends; Minnesota, a written notice of the terms and how to end them at least once a calendar year, retention offers only with consent, simple online cancel where the site has account management; Massachusetts, notice 5–30 days before a renewal of a term over 31 days, and for shorter terms a pre-renewal notice or a receipt with every charge showing the amount and how to cancel, and cancellation through the same site or app used to sign up. |
| S5 | UK DMCC Act 2024, Part 4 Chapter 2 (subscription contracts) | Carson McDowell article of 3 Sep 2026 | **Secondary.** Reports commencement brought forward to January 2027; the secondary legislation on exit and notices is still to come. Other secondary pages of 2026 said "spring 2027", so the date itself is uncertain. |

Other US states with automatic-renewal laws (New York GBL §527-a, Colorado,
Virginia, Vermont, Oregon, Illinois, others) were **not read** in this part. Until each is read, the matrix applies the strictest window found
above to every buyer and plan, wherever they are.

## 2. The matrix: what each rule asks

Windows are before the event. "Strictest" is the window that satisfies every
row read so far.

| Obligation | S1 ROSCA | S3 California | S4 EU | S5 UK | Strictest, applied until more is read |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clear disclosure of all material terms before billing details | Yes (§8403(1)) | Yes ((a)(1), acknowledgment (a)(3)) | General pre-contract info (Dir. 2011/83) | Pre-contract info | Show product, price, currency, frequency, that it renews until canceled, how to cancel, before the card is asked. |
| Express, affirmative consent to the recurring charge | "Express informed consent" (§8403(2)) | "Express affirmative consent" ((a)(4)) | — | Expected | A separate, unchecked consent to the renewal terms; payment refused without it. |
| Keep proof of consent | Implied by the burden of proof | Implied | — | — | Store text version, price, currency, frequency, time, channel, subscription id; keep per the owner's rule: 3 years or 1 year after the subscription ends, whichever is longer. |
| Notice before a free trial or promotional period of **more than 31 days** ends | — | 3–21 days ((b)(1)(A)) | — | Expected | 3–21 days. |
| Notice before an **annual** (or longer) term renews | — | 15–45 days ((b)(2)) | — | Expected (reminders) | **Conflict (S6):** California 15–45, Massachusetts 5–30, Utah 30–60 as reported; the only day all three allow is the 30th. Applied: send from 30 days (never earlier than the stricter maximum) and never report one sent inside the last 15 days as on time. **Depende do dono** once the official texts are read: whether Utah's minimum is met by a notice 29–30 days before. |
| Notice before each renewal of a term of 31 days or less (monthly) | — | — | — | — | Massachusetts as reported (S6): a pre-renewal notice or a receipt with every charge, with the amount and how to cancel. **Gap G11.** |
| Notice before a **price change** | — | 7–30 days ((g)(2)) | — | Expected | 7–30 days. |
| Annual reminder of the terms | — | Minnesota (S6): once a calendar year, terms and how to end them. California (h)(1)–(2): annual reminder with frequency and amount (scope to confirm on leginfo) | — | Expected | One reminder a year per subscription, with frequency and amount. |
| Online cancellation | "Simple mechanisms" (§8403(3)) | Exclusively online, at will, no obstructing step; prominent direct link or button ((d)(1)) | "Withdraw from contract here" + "confirm withdrawal", during the withdrawal period, acknowledgment on a durable medium (Art. 11a) | Easy exit (rules pending) | A direct cancel control in one press plus one confirmation, never a GET, no phone, email or new sign-up; an acknowledgment by email. |
| Save offers | — | Allowed only if the cancel control stays prominent, continuous and beside the offer ((e), (e)(2)) | — | — | The cancel control stays on the same screen as any offer, and declining is one press. |

## 3. What the code does today (audit of main)

Found by reading the code; file references are to main above.

**Marktmorgen's own plans**

- Notices: `lib/billing-reminders.ts`, sent by the daily cron
  `app/api/cron/reminders/route.ts`. Trial end: on the first daily run with
  at most 8 days left (`TRIAL_NOTICE_SECONDS`). Yearly renewal: on the first
  daily run with **at most 30 days** left (`YEAR_NOTICE_SECONDS`). Both are
  still sent down to 1 day before (`TOO_LATE_SECONDS`).
  **Gap G1:** neither has a floor (PR #1296 marks a late notice, keeps the 30-day start). A trial notice missed until fewer than 3
  days remain, or a renewal notice missed until fewer than 15, is sent late
  and looks on time; nothing records that the window was missed.
- No monthly notice or per-charge receipt from Marktmorgen (Massachusetts' rule for terms of 31 days or less, **gap G11**; Stripe's own receipts, if switched on, are not proof here), no price-change notice
  (**gap G2**), no annual reminder (**gap G3**), no notice for add-ons such as
  the Store assistant (**gap G4**, `isAddOn` skips them).
- Cancellation: `POST /api/billing/cancel` (`setCancelAtPeriodEnd`); the
  buttons are forms with `method="post"`. **Gap G5:** in the studio's paid
  view (`app/studio/page.tsx`) the cancel form sits closed inside a
  `<details>`, after the plan-switch options, so it is reachable but not a
  prominent direct control. There is no save offer today only because
  `PLAN_BREAKS_ENABLED` is false (`lib/plan-pause-rules.ts`); with it on,
  "Take a break instead" is a save offer shown before the cancel control,
  which must meet the same-screen rule before the flag is turned on. No
  emailed acknowledgment follows a cancellation.
- Consent: the plan checkout (`lib/billing.ts`) records no recurring-charge
  consent (**gap G6**).

**Buyers of creators' subscriptions and memberships** (direct charges on the
creator's Stripe account)

- No notice of any kind before a renewal, a trial end or a price change
  (**gap G7**). Creators' trials may last up to 90 days (`MAX_TRIAL_DAYS`,
  `lib/product-recurring.ts`), so the 3–21-day notice for trials over 31 days
  is owed on some of them. Only static words at checkout and on the thanks page
  (`lib/buyer-words/thanks.ts`).
- Cancellation: an emailed one-hour link to `app/[handle]/manage`, whose
  Cancel is a POST to `app/api/store/manage/cancel` that opens Stripe's
  portal with `subscription_cancel` at period end. A one-time coupon offer is
  added in Stripe's flow (`lib/membership-manage.ts`, `lib/save-offer.ts`),
  and the manage page keeps its own Cancel button. **To confirm (G8):** that
  Stripe's retention screen keeps the cancel button beside the coupon offer
  in the sense of §17602(e)(2); no emailed acknowledgment of the
  cancellation from Marktmorgen (Stripe's own email, if enabled on the
  creator's account, is the creator's setting and is not proof here).
- **Gap G10:** where a store has no manage page (`canManage(store)` false),
  the thanks page tells the buyer to cancel by replying to the order email
  (`renewsForReply`, `renewsUntilReply` in `lib/buyer-words/thanks.ts`): an
  email-only path that the strictest row rules out.
- Consent: the EU digital-withdrawal consent (`lib/digital-consent.ts`) is a
  different consent; it stores version, kind and time but not the renewal
  terms, the price or the text. **Gap G9:** no specific consent to the
  recurring charge, and no proof record with terms and price.

## 4. Order of the next PRs (each with tests that fail on the wrong behavior)

1. **Consent proof (G6, G9).** One unchecked "I agree to be charged
   <amount> every <period> until I cancel" consent, versioned, refused
   server-side without it, for buyers and plans; proof record (text hash and
   version, amount, currency, frequency, time, channel, subscription id, no
   extra personal data) kept 3 years or 1 year after the end, whichever is
   longer. Prerequisite: the storage cost of the record per plan at full use,
   with its cap, before it is written (MR rule).
2. **Notice windows (G1–G4).** One pure rule module with the strictest
   windows of section 2, a `missed` state that is recorded instead of a late
   notice dressed as on time, idempotency per subscription, event and window
   version; reuse `lib/billing-reminders.ts`.
3. **Buyer notices (G7).** The same rules for creators' subscriptions, from
   Marktmorgen's own polling of the creator's Stripe account, paid from a
   measured cap per store before the obligation is taken on; a failed send is
   recorded as not sent, never as sent.
4. **Cancellation (G5, G8, G10)**, and the per-charge receipt or notice of G11. A direct cancel control in every state, POST
   only, one confirmation, emailed acknowledgment; the coupon offer only with
   the cancel control on the same screen.
5. **Matrix completion.** Read on the official sites, with dates: leginfo
   §17602 and §17601, EUR-Lex 2023/2673, the UK regulations once made, and
   the other states' laws; record any divergence in "Depende do dono".

Every new email is owner-side or buyer-side transactional mail and must be
priced in `lib/cost-table.ts`-style worst cases per plan (monthly and annual,
100% use) before it is switched on; unknown cost is not zero.

## 5. What this part does not do

No code, no email, no Stripe call, no account, no contact with any authority
or third party. No figure or sentence in the product changes.

## 6. Official texts read on 30 Oct 2026, after the owner's decision of 16h29

The owner decided (30 Oct 2026, 16h29 Fortaleza, "faça o correto") that no
notice window may rest on a secondary source. This section records what was
read on the official site of each jurisdiction on 30 Oct 2026, between 17h50
and 18h15 Fortaleza. Each page was read through a page reader that returns
summaries and short quotations; the quotations below are as it returned them,
and anybody relying on a figure should open the page. Nothing here is legal
advice, and nothing certifies that Marktmorgen complies with any law.

| # | Jurisdiction and text | Official page read | To whom | Contracts covered | Window | Counted from | Required content |

The current text of GBL §527-a was **not read** on an official page. | — | — |

### What the official texts change

1. **The annual notice: one day still fits every rule read.** For an annual
   plan whose cancellation deadline is the renewal moment (Marktmorgen lets a
   plan be canceled until the renewal), the windows read are: Utah 30–60
   days before renewal (O1), Illinois 30–60 before the deadline (O2),
   Virginia 30–60 (O3), Massachusetts 5–30 (O4), and California 15–45 (S3,
   still secondary). The only day all of them allow is the 30th calendar day
   before the renewal. PR #1296's start at 30 days stands; the "late" marking
   of a notice found under the floor stands. Each day count is calendar days
   in the customer's local date where known; an unknown location is held to
   the 30th day in the earliest time zone that applies, so no window is
   missed anywhere.
2. **New gap G12 — Utah and monthly plans.** As read (O1), Utah's 30–60-day
   renewal notice has no condition on the term's length. Taken literally, a
   monthly plan renewing every 28–31 days cannot receive a notice 30–60 days
   before each renewal. Whether a monthly term is covered is a question of
   reading the whole chapter (definitions, §13-70-101) and any official
   guidance; until then the protective reading applies to Utah customers:
   **Depende do dono / to read next:** §13-70-101 and the Utah Division of
   Consumer Protection's guidance. Possible protective designs, not built:
   send each monthly renewal notice at the earliest moment the term allows,
   or treat a Utah customer's monthly plan as needing a fresh notice of the
   next renewal at sign-up. Nothing is switched on, so no customer is exposed
   today (sales are closed).
3. **G11 confirmed for Massachusetts (O4, 38.05(6)).** For a term of 31 days
   or less the amount must be disclosed at least as often as the charge: a
   per-charge receipt or notice with the amount meets the text as read. The
   notice must go through a medium like the sign-up's: email for an online
   sign-up.
4. **Price changes.** Virginia (O3) asks a notice before any material change,
   price included, with how to cancel, and sets no day count; California's
   7–30 days (S3, secondary) stays the applied window. No price change is
   planned (owner's rule), so nothing is sent.
5. **The FTC rule (O5)** removes the federal "click to cancel" as a
   requirement; the cancellation rules still come from ROSCA, California
   (secondary), Massachusetts 38.05(3) and the EU (S4). The design already
   holds the strictest.

### Still not read on an official site (each stays at the protective reading)

California §17602 and §17601 on leginfo (the page asked for a permission the
scheduled run could not get; S3 remains secondary), New York GBL §527-a's
current text, Colorado C.R.S. §6-1-732, Oregon ORS 646A.295, District of
Columbia, Minnesota, Virginia's 2026 amendments (cc. 931, 932) by themselves
and §59.1-207.45's definition of consumer, the EU text on EUR-Lex (Directive
2023/2673, Art. 11a), the UK regulations under the DMCC Act once made, and
Canada (federal and provincial). PR #1296 stays unmerged until those that can
reach a buyer or creator are read; the next scheduled run continues the list.

### Cost of extra notices

None so far: one annual notice on one day meets every window read. If G12
requires a notice before each monthly renewal for Utah customers, that is one
email a month per monthly subscription in Utah, at the email rate of the cost
table, capped before it is sent; it will be priced in the PR that builds it.

## 7. More official texts read on 30 Oct 2026 (18h00–18h20 Fortaleza), and what they change in PR #1296

Read the same way as section 6 (official pages, through a page reader that
returns summaries and short quotations).

| # | Jurisdiction and text | Official page read | Contracts covered | Window | Counted from | Required content |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| O8 | Colorado, C.R.S. §6-1-732, as enacted by HB 21-1239 (effective 1 Jan 2022, for contracts made on or after it) | content.leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021A/bills/2021a_1239_enr.pdf (the enrolled act; later amendments **not read**) | A paid subscription or purchasing agreement automatically renewed (exemptions in (5)) | (4)(b) "at least twenty-five and no more than forty days before the first automatic renewal" and each later one; for a term under twelve months, once in that window before the renewal that extends the contract past each continuous twelve months. Trial: no day count, cancel before paying. Material change: clear notice, no day count | The renewal | Per (4) (not quoted here) |
| O9 | District of Columbia Code §28A-203 (D.C. Law 22-235, 2019; amended by D.C. Law 23-16) | code.dccouncil.gov/us/dc/council/code/sections/28A-203 | (b) an initial term of 12 months or more renewing for one month or more; (c) free trials | (b) "no fewer than 30 days and no more than 60 days before the cancellation deadline", at the first renewal and annually after; (c) "at least 15 and no more than 30 days before the expiration of the free trial period" | The cancellation deadline; the trial's expiry | That it renews unless canceled, the renewal term's cost, the deadline to cancel, how to get the procedures; by email, active links to cancel. The page carries two conflicting notes on whether the section is implemented (budget approval); the protective reading treats it as in force |
| O10 | Minnesota Statutes 2026, §§325G.56–325G.63 | revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/325G/pdf | Agreements with a consumer in Minnesota subject to automatic renewal or continuous service | 325G.57 subd. 4: a free trial over 30 days, "no fewer than five days and no more than 30 days before the end"; subd. 5: a written reminder "at least once per calendar year via mail or email" (continuous service); subd. 3: a material change "prior to the implementation" | The trial's end | Terms and how to end or manage the service (subd. 5) |

Not found or not read: Oregon ORS 646A.293–295 (the 2025 edition page was
read but the reader did not reach the two sections; the 2026 amendments table
was not read); Utah §13-70-101 (the page returned only navigation, so G12
stays open).

### The windows after sections 6 and 7

- **Annual renewal.** Utah 30–60 before the renewal (O1), Illinois 30–60
  before the cancellation deadline (O2), Virginia 30–60 (O3), Massachusetts
  5–30 (O4), Colorado 25–40 (O8), DC 30–60 (O9), California 15–45 (S3,
  secondary). With the deadline at the renewal, **the only day allowed by all
  of them is the 30th calendar day before the renewal.**
- **Trial ending** (a trial over 31 days). DC 15–30 (O9), Minnesota 5–30
  (O10), California 3–21 (S3, secondary), Utah at least 3 (O1): **15 to 21
  days before the trial ends.**
- **New gap G13 — Colorado and monthly plans (O8).** A plan with a term under
  twelve months needs a notice 25–40 days before the renewal that carries it
  past each twelve continuous months. Together with Minnesota's yearly
  reminder (O10) and California's annual reminder (S3), a monthly plan needs
  one notice a year, sent 25–40 days before the renewal that completes each
  twelve months, with the terms and how to cancel.

### What PR #1296 must change before it can be merged

PR #1296 marks a yearly notice late only under 15 days left (California's
floor) and a trial notice only under 7. Against the official texts read:

1. A yearly renewal notice sent with fewer than 30 days left is outside Utah's,
   Illinois', Virginia's and DC's windows: the floor must be the 30th day,
   so anything later is marked late, never on time.
2. A trial notice must start 21 days before the trial ends and is late under
   15 days.
3. G12 (Utah, monthly) and G13 (Colorado, monthly: one notice a year) need
   their own notices.
4. Calendar days are counted in the customer's own date where known; with an
   unknown location, the 30th day is taken in the earliest time zone that
   could apply, so it is never early or late anywhere.

These changes go into PR #1296 (claude/kx1-notice-floors); it stays unmerged
until California's official text and the remaining jurisdictions of section 6
are read.

## 8. New York, the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada, read on 30 Oct 2026 (18h00–18h10 Fortaleza)

Read the same way as sections 6 and 7.

Canada: Ontario's consumer page (ontario.ca, updated 1 Apr 2025) sets no
renewal-notice rule for subscriptions; the Consumer Protection Act, 2023 and
Quebec's law were **not read**. The EU Art. 11a text on EUR-Lex was **not
read** (it is a withdrawal function, not a renewal notice).

### The windows after sections 6 to 8

- **Annual renewal:** New York 15–45 before the deadline (O11) adds nothing
  narrower; **the 30th calendar day before the renewal** still fits every
  rule read. PR #1296 (head abb7a19) applies it.
- **Trial over a month:** New York 3–21 (O11), DC 15–30, Minnesota 5–30,
  California 3–21: still **15 to 21 days before the end**. Marktmorgen's own
  trial is 14 days (`TRIAL_DAYS`), under New York's, Minnesota's and
  California's thresholds; DC's §28A-203(c) as read states no threshold, so
  **gap G14:** a 14-day trial cannot get a notice 15–30 days before it ends;
  the protective reading needs the notice at sign-up for DC customers, or a
  reading of §28A-202's definition of free trial. To read next.
- **Price change:** New York at least five business days and at most 30 days
  before the change (O11), California 7–30 (secondary): **7 calendar days
  and five business days, whichever is later, to 30 days.** No price change
  is planned.
- **New gap G15 — Germany (O14).** A German consumer's annual subscription
  in a creator's store may not renew tacitly for another year under standard
  terms: after the first term it must become open-ended and cancelable with
  at most one month's notice. This touches buyers' annual memberships
  (Stripe Billing on the creator's account) and Marktmorgen's own yearly
  plan for a consumer in Germany; it is a contract-terms and refund question,
  and goes into the cancellation PR (G5/G8/G10) of section 4.
- **UK (O12–O13):** nothing fixed before 1 Jan 2027; the design keeps a
  reminder before every renewal of a six-month or longer term.

Still to read: California (leginfo), Oregon, Utah §13-70-101, DC §28A-202,
Virginia §59.1-207.45 and its 2026 amendments, Colorado's later amendments,
EUR-Lex 2023/2673, Canada (federal and provinces). PR #1296 stays unmerged.

## 9. Who the rules protect: creators included (read 30 Oct 2026, 18h10–18h20 Fortaleza)

| # | Text | Official page read | Finding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| O15 | Virginia Code §59.1-207.45 (history 2018 c. 704; 2023 c. 288; 2024 c. 452; 2026 cc. 931, 932) | law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title59.1/chapter17.8/section59.1-207.45/ | "Consumer" is (i) an individual for personal, family or household purposes, or (ii) **a small business acquiring goods or services for business purposes** (at least 51% independently owned and controlled by individuals, or a qualifying cooperative). "Automatic renewal" is a paid subscription renewed at the end of a definite term for a further term of more than one month. |
| O16 | Virginia Code §59.1-207.46(D) | as O3 | A free trial over 30 days: the notice comes "within 30 days of the end of any such free trial" (read protectively as no more than 30 days before the end). |
| O17 | DC Code §28A-202 | code.dccouncil.gov/us/dc/council/code/sections/28A-202 | "Consumer" is any person who seeks or acquires goods or services (no personal-use condition read); "free trial" is not defined there. The page says the section's creation "has not been implemented"; the protective reading treats it as in force. |

**What it changes.** Marktmorgen's creators are small businesses. Virginia's
annual notice (O3) reaches a Virginia creator's yearly plan, and DC's
definition as read does not exclude businesses; Utah's (O1) speaks of "an
individual" who receives the service. So the creator-plan notices of PR #1296
are required for creators too, not only a courtesy, and stay on for every
creator whatever their location. G14 stays open (DC's trial notice and a
14-day trial; "free trial" has no definition in §28A-202). Utah §13-70-101
could not be read (the page returned no text).

## 10. PR #1296 after review, and gap G16 (30 Oct 2026, 18h10 Fortaleza)

An independent review of PR #1296 found that "the 30th day" was decided by
elapsed seconds: with the daily run at 10:00 UTC, a renewal charged late in
the UTC day was first noticed on the 29th calendar day and still reported on
time. Fixed on the branch (82fd087 and after): the yearly window compares UTC
calendar dates, the notice is first due on the 30th day before the charge's
date whatever the hour, and any later day is sent but marked late. A
mutation back to elapsed days makes 2 of 10 checks fail.

**Gap G16 — local dates.** The statutes count days in the customer's own
calendar. The daily run (10:00 UTC) falls on the same date in every US zone
from UTC−4 to UTC−10, but a charge between 00:00 and about 10:00 UTC falls on
the previous local date for some or all US zones, so the UTC count can be a
day off for them. Settling it needs the creator's time zone (or a run per
zone) and a rule for an unknown zone; until then PR #1296 stays unmerged,
with the other open points: California's official text, Oregon, Utah
§13-70-101, Canada, G12–G15, and two review findings recorded for the next
unit: a notice missed until one day or less before the charge is dropped
without being counted as missed (`TOO_LATE_SECONDS`), and a cancellation
scheduled after the next renewal (`cancel_at` later than the charge) gets no
notice for that renewal.
