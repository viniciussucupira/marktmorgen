# Store assistant (paid add-on), 17 Oct 2026

One add-on, **Store assistant, $49 a month per store**, on any plan once the plan is paid (not during the trial). It has three functions that share one monthly pool of AI replies, built in this order:

1. **24/7 store Q&A chat** on every page of the store, grounded only in the creator's own published products, pages and FAQ. **Built here** (`lib/store-assistant-rules.ts`, `lib/store-assistant.ts`, `components/store-assistant.tsx`, `app/api/store/assistant`).
2. **After-purchase next product** chosen among the creator's own products. **Built** (`lib/next-offer-rules.ts`, `lib/next-offer.ts`, `components/next-offer-card.tsx`, `components/next-offer-box.tsx`, `app/api/store/assistant-next`), design below.
3. **One reminder after a checkout left unpaid, only when asked for at checkout.** **Built** (`lib/assistant-reminder-rules.ts`, `lib/assistant-reminder.ts`, `components/assistant-reminder-box.tsx`, `lib/buyer-words/assistant-reminder.ts`, `remindAssisted` in `lib/checkout-recovery.ts`), design below.

It is published but **not sold**: `ASSISTANT_ON_SALE` (`lib/opening.ts`) is `PLANS_ON_SALE && assistantMeetsFloor()`, and `PLANS_ON_SALE` stays false behind the commercial review and the most-tax reading (`docs/tax-uncertainty.md`). The checkout route refuses with `assistant=not-open` and never reaches Stripe.

## Market (read 17 Oct 2026, scratchpad research, official pages)

- Kajabi Sales Agent: $79/month per agent on a $179+ plan, 1,000 messages + 250 AI credits, hand-over to a person is manual only ("does not escalate automatically"), lead capture by email only, GPT-5.4.
- HighLevel Conversation AI (H36): Growth $50/month for 1,000 agent responses; Unlimited $97 "fair use".
- Circle agents only on Scale ($419) / Plus; Thinkific Thinker only on Plus; Stan, ClickFunnels, Skool: no buyer-facing agent; Hotmart Tutor answers "as if it were you" (what this must never do).

How this one is different, each in code: works on every plan; hands over by itself (keyword pre-check before any model call, and the model's own `handoff` status) into the existing inbox with the buyer's email; refuses in code any reply with a number, a deal word, a code or a link that is not in the creator's own published words (`heldToFacts`); the AI label is drawn by the page and sent by the server, never written by the model; the chat becomes a no-AI "leave your question" form when the month is used. It gives fewer replies a month than Kajabi or HighLevel (700): that is what the owner's 60% floor allows at $49 with every cost counted, and the page says the number.

## Cost per message and the allowance (binding)

Model: **Claude Haiku 5.5**, the cheapest current model (platform.claude.com pricing, re-read 17 Oct 2026: $0.10 in / $0.50 out per million tokens for prompts up to 100,000 tokens; $0.50 / $2.50 above, which the 24 KiB cap never reaches). Fixed in `ASSISTANT_MODEL`, not overridable by a deployment setting.

Worst case of one message, `assistantMessageWorstMicroUsd()` = **$0.003539**:

- model hold at the caps (`ASSISTANT_INPUT_BYTES` 24,576 bytes counted as tokens + framing, `ASSISTANT_OUTPUT_TOKENS` 320), the cost table's 10% provider allowance (invoice tax, FX, remittance to the provider) and the 45-second function wait at 2 GB: **$0.003339** (`aiRequestHoldMicroUsd`, `lib/spend-cost-table.ts`);
- the message's own database work: 40 commands, the store record (1 MB at most), 40 products and 6 stored pages read, the conversation read and written, and a day of keeping it plus four months of one unanswered question: **$0.000200**.

One payment of $49 at full use (`assistantMonthWorst()`), all in whole cents rounded up, received in the one model every plan and add-on is held to since 18 October 2026 (`lib/receiving-costs.ts`; `docs/margin-alignment-2026-10-18.md` is generated from it and holds the figures for every unit):

| Line | Cents |
|---|---:|
| Dearer provider's fee on the amount charged, $49 plus the buyer's tax on top at 27% ($62.23): Stripe 2.9% + 1.5% international + 1% conversion + 0.7% Billing + 0.5% Tax = 6.6% + 30¢ (Paddle 5% + 50¢ is cheaper) | 444 |
| Remittance allowance, 1.5% of revenue | 74 |
| Dispute reserve: 1 payment in 100 lost with both $15 fees, on the amount charged | 93 |
| Refund reserve: 1 payment in 100 refunded (refunds only where the law requires) | 49 |
| AI: 700 replies at the worst | 248 |
| **Total** | **908** |
| Most a payment may cost and keep 60% after 27.5% (P × 5/29, `maximumPretaxCostCents`) | 844 |
| Room kept (`ADD_ON_ROOM_CENTS` ≥ 25) | −64 |

Net after 27.5%: **59.06%**, $0.46 short of 60%. Until 18 October 2026 the fee and the dispute reserve were taken on the price alone (354 and 79 cents), as if no tax were added on top, which kept 60.59%. The one lever that is not a printed figure is the input sent to the model per reply (`ASSISTANT_INPUT_BYTES`, `ASSISTANT_FACTS_BYTES`); cutting it shortens the catalog the assistant reads for a buyer, which a buyer sees, and the owner ruled out cutting what a customer sees (18 October 2026). So `assistantMeetsFloor()` is false and the add-on is not on sale (`ASSISTANT_ON_SALE`), whatever the plans do. Under the most-tax reading (VAT 27% inside the price, US 37%, California 13.3%, Brazil 27.5% and IOF without credit, ISS 5% of revenue) it keeps about 12%: it fails like everything else.

Emails and inbox messages a hand-over makes are taken from the plan's own figures (`inbox`, `store-email` lines of `tests/plan-cost-registry.ts`) and refused past them, so a plan's worst month is unchanged by the add-on. Non-AI requests of the chat (read, delete, hand-over) are public requests of the store's window (`withinStore`).

The registry line is `ADD_ON_LINES` → `store-assistant` in `tests/plan-cost-registry.ts`; `OPEN` stays `[]`. The terms are bound into `CURRENT_COMMERCIAL_TERMS.storeAssistant` (schema 19), so any change invalidates an earlier review.

## Enforcement (before every model call)

`nl:assist:pool:<statsId>:<add-on period start>` holds the month in micro-USD (`ASSISTANT_POOL`, one Lua script, real-Redis test `scripts/test_assistant_pool_redis.py`):

- `reserve` this request's own worst cost before the fetch; refused (0) when the pool cannot hold it → the chat becomes the creator form, no AI cost;
- `settle` at what the model billed (its `usage` token counts at the same rates and allowance, plus the fixed parts), giving back the rest;
- `release` whole when the provider answered with an error status (not billed); a timeout or lost connection may have been billed, so it is settled at the full hold;
- the cap a month opened with is kept and only ever lowered; the key expires 40 days after it opened.

The window is the add-on's own paid month (`assistantWindow`), with the same two-day renewal grace as `lib/allowance-window.ts`; unknown is closed. Only `status: active` answers (no grace for an unpaid month of AI). Burst limits: 10 per visitor in 10 minutes, 40 a day, 20 per store a minute.

## Billing

Its own monthly Stripe subscription on the store's existing customer (`lib/assistant-billing.ts`): a yearly plan cannot carry a monthly line, and `planOf`/`periodStart`/`tier-switch` read a subscription's first item as the plan. Metadata `addon=assistant`, `assistant_for=<handle>`, never `store`, so `findStoreSubscriptions` and the daily sync never read it as a plan; `failedPlan`/`dueReminder` pass it over. The first payment asks for 3-D Secure. The daily sync (`lib/billing-sync.ts`) brings it in line, ends it at once on a disputed payment (and never sells it to that store again), and sets it to stop at the period's end when the plan is no longer paid.

## Privacy

Kept: the conversation for 24 hours after its last message under a random token in the buyer's browser, with addresses, phone numbers and links taken out (the model never sees them either); deletable at once ("Delete this chat"). Unanswered questions for the creator for ~4 months, never who asked. A hand-over goes into the inbox with the email the buyer typed, kept and erased as the inbox is (180 days, `lib/person-erasure.ts`). Registry: `lib/person-data.ts`. Privacy policy `#store-assistant`, Terms `#store-assistant`, Refund Policy `#store-assistant`.

## Function 2: one next product after a purchase (built 17 Oct 2026)

Switched on by the creator (`store.nextOffer`, studio, Pages → Store assistant), shown only while the add-on's month is paid (`nextOfferShown`). On the thanks page after a paid order, streamed in a `<Suspense>` boundary so the page never waits on it, one card: the product's title, its published price (`pricePill`), its own summary, a link to its own page (an ordinary checkout) and "No thanks" (`app/api/store/assistant-next`, kept as dismissed for the order). Not shown while an offer after paying is waiting on the buyer, or while a page funnel's next step is.

**What may be offered.** Only a product the store lists and can sell today (`canSellProduct`), with no limited number, not a bundle the buyer builds or one holding something owned; never the product bought, anything in the order (boxes, bundle items, offers taken after paying), anything turned down after paying (`FunnelView.declined`), or anything the address bought before: its completed checkouts and one-click offers on the creator's Stripe account, by the address paid with, and imported purchases (`ownedHere`; a Stripe error or more than one page means nothing is offered).

**How it is chosen** (`nextChoice`): the creator's picks ("goes well with"), then the product's offers after paying, then its checkout boxes, then the rest of a collection it is in; otherwise the store's order. Only in that last case, with at least two candidates (`modelAddsValue`), is the model asked to pick one by number among at most 16 candidates (plus up to 8 of the creator's own choices read), told only the products' titles, prices, delivery and summaries, nothing about the buyer. It is labeled "AI suggestion" by the page; its one sentence of why is shown only when `heldToFacts` passes against those products' published lines, otherwise the product's own summary is. A choice out of range, an error or a spent pool falls back to the store's order.

**Cost.** The model call is reserved from the same pool (`ASSISTANT_POOL`) at `min(assistantMessageWorstMicroUsd(), this request's hold + assistantMessageExtraMicroUsd())`, exactly as a chat message, settled at the billed tokens, released only when the provider answered with an error status, kept whole on a timeout. Its output is capped at 120 tokens and its reads (16 + 8 listings, one product record, about 36 commands) stay inside a chat message's priced extras (`withinAssistantReply`, tests/next-offer.test.ts), so one choice never costs more than one reply and **the add-on's month is unchanged: 700 replies, $8.04 of $8.44 allowed, 60.59% net after 27.5%** (`ADD_ON_LINES`, `OPEN` stays `[]`). Its reads and up to five Stripe calls count as `NEXT_OFFER_REQUEST_UNITS` = 6 public requests of the plan's window ($0.000378 against a worst of $0.000174, `NEXT_OFFER_READ`). One choice per order, kept 3 days under the checkout id (`nl:assist:next:`), with a one-minute lock (`nl:assist:nextlock:`), so reloads and the email ask nothing more.

**Email.** With "Also in the order's confirmation email" checked, the order's own confirmation (`lib/purchase-email.ts`) carries the kept choice in a few lines (label, title, price, its words, its link, "You see this because you agreed to hear from …"), only when the checkout's `news` consent is "yes". It never asks the model and never sends an email of its own; a buyer who never reached the thanks page gets no suggestion. Owner to confirm with counsel: the EU basis for a product mention inside a transactional email (here: explicit consent at checkout).

## Function 3: one checkout reminder, only when asked for (built 17 Oct 2026)

**Legal design: conservative, consent only**, because the owner has not yet confirmed with counsel which EU basis applies (consent or legitimate interest). Switched on by the creator (`store.assistReminder`, studio, Pages → Store assistant), offered only while the add-on's month is paid and the store has the postal address of its checkout reminders (`store.recovery.address`; without it the studio says why, the box is not shown and nothing is sent).

**The yes.** The buy box and the cart show an unchecked box, "Email me a reminder if I don't finish this order" (in the store's language, `lib/buyer-words/assistant-reminder.ts`), with an email field shown once it is checked (`.ask-remind`, works without scripts). Not a call, a gift, a purchase for a group or a pre-order. The checkout routes keep a yes only with the box checked, a valid address and the page's sentence version `ASSIST_REMIND_VERSION`: `nl:assist:remind:<checkout id>` = the address, the exact sentence, its version, its language and the time (ms), for `ASSIST_REMIND_KEEP_SECONDS` (3 days from the checkout opening), with the checkout noted under a one-way hash of the address for the same 3 days (`nl:assist:remindwho:`) so erasure finds it (`forgetAssistReminderPerson`, in `lib/person-erasure.ts` ERASERS); the queue `nl:assist:remindq` holds the store, its handle and the checkout, never an address. A checkout with the box checked closes after an hour (`expires_at`). Typing an address is never taken as consent. At most `ASSIST_REMINDERS_PER_STORE_DAY` = 50 yeses a store a day.

**The email** (`remindFromConsent`, every five minutes from `app/api/cron/mail`): an hour after the checkout closed (`ASSIST_REMIND_AFTER_SECONDS`), dropped six hours later. It reads the checkout from the creator's Stripe account: paid → nothing; still open → once more an hour after it closes. Then the shared `deliver` of `lib/checkout-recovery.ts`: never twice for one checkout (`nl:recover:sent:`, the same mark as Stripe's opt-in path, which now skips a checkout that has this yes), not when that address paid for those products since, pressed stop, left the list, bounced or was deleted (`lib/suppression.ts`), and not about the same products to the same address twice in a week. From the creator's name, with the postal address, the stop link (at once) and `List-Unsubscribe` one-click, the subject "You left … at checkout" / "Your cart at …", today's price, and "It reached you because you checked "…" at checkout on <day>." No discount, countdown, stock or review.

**The AI line** (`assistReminderNote`): only while the add-on's month is paid. The model gets the products' titles, descriptions and delivery (no price, nothing about the buyer), writes one line of at most 25 words, capped at `ASSIST_REMIND_OUTPUT_TOKENS` = 80; `neutralLine` refuses any digit, link, exclamation, deal word or pressure word (seven languages) or what `heldToFacts` refuses. It appears under "Written by AI from <store>'s own product descriptions:", drawn by the code. Spent pool, failed call or refused line: the same email with no AI line.

**Cost and margin.** The model call is reserved from `ASSISTANT_POOL` at `min(assistantMessageWorstMicroUsd(), this request's hold + assistantMessageExtraMicroUsd())`, settled at billed tokens, released only on a provider error status, kept whole on a timeout. Its products (4), output (80 tokens) and commands (40) stay inside a chat reply's caps (`withinReminderReply`), so **the add-on's month is unchanged: 700 replies, $8.04 of $8.44 allowed, 60.59% net after 27.5%** (`ADD_ON_LINES`, `OPEN` stays `[]`). The email is one of the store's own emails (`store-email` line): its room is read before the model is asked and it is taken before sending, refused past the figure. Its reads and two Stripe calls are `ASSIST_REMIND_REQUEST_UNITS` = 4 public requests ($0.000252 against a worst of $0.000187, `ASSIST_REMIND_READ`). The yes is at most 768 bytes and its note 256 bytes, for 3 days, 50 a store a day (`tests/store-data-registry.ts`). Commercial terms schema 21 (`CURRENT_COMMERCIAL_TERMS.storeAssistant.reminder`).

**Owner to confirm with counsel:** the EU basis (consent is used; legitimate interest is not relied on), whether three days of consent evidence is enough or it should be kept longer, and that a store's checkout reminder is a commercial email under CAN-SPAM (built as one: identity, postal address, opt-out).

## Follow-ups (not in this PR)

The reminder does not answer a question the buyer asked the chat in the same browser (it would need the chat token on the checkout session); it is not offered on calls (whose time is held only while the checkout is open), gifts, group purchases or pre-orders.

Also open: the buyer-language bridge (the creator reads a handed-over question translated and their answer goes back in the buyer's language) and citing the source block of each answer in the chat.
