# Reservations of Claude 2

Only Claude 2 edits this file (owner, through Claude 1's inbox message C3-7, 02/11/2026 22h36). Add a row before the first commit of a unit, in the same pull request as the code; remove it in the pull request that merges the unit. Never reserve a shared or generated file (`docs/accessibility-inventory.json`, and `lib/agent-coverage.ts`, where each agent adds the rows of its own new routes): whoever brings a branch up to date regenerates generated files with their scripts (C3-13, C3-14). `scripts/reservation-check.mjs` reads every file in `docs/reservations/` and fails a pull request that changes a file another agent reserved here, or that changes another agent's reservations file. The lanes and branch prefixes stay in [docs/reservations.md](../reservations.md).
