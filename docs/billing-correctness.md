# 569 [NC1] — Every path that charges money: inventory (30 Oct 2026)

Unit 1 of 569 [NC1] (owner's request of 30 Oct 2026, 16h33 Fortaleza: no wrong
or undue charge may ever reach a customer, everything automatic, no manual
work for the owner). This file is the inventory the item asks for in step 1.
It is a document only: it changes no code, no price, no limit and no flag.

**How it was made.** Read from the code on main (30 Oct 2026, about 20h55
Fortaleza) with grep and by reading the functions named below; nothing was
run against Stripe or PayPal. "Tests" names the test files that import or
mock the path; importing a module does not prove the Stripe write itself is
asserted, and where that was not checked the row says **unverified**. Line
numbers are approximate guides, not references to rely on after later edits.

**What this inventory does not yet show.** It does not prove any path
charges the right amount; that is units 2 to 6. A path marked "no key" is a
place where a repeated request could reach Stripe twice; whether that can
charge twice depends on the path (a second Checkout Session is not a charge
until the buyer pays it), and each is decided in unit 3.

## How Marktmorgen writes to Stripe

No Stripe SDK is used. Every write is a raw `fetch` through one of:

- `onPlatform` / `onPlatformAt` (`lib/billing.ts`): Marktmorgen's own
  (platform) account; optional `idempotencyKey`.
- `onAccount` (`lib/stripe-account.ts`): the creator's connected account
  (`Stripe-Account` header), direct charges; optional `idempotencyKey`.

No route receives Stripe webhook events: no `Stripe-Signature` /
`constructEvent` was found in `app/` or `lib/`. State is read back from Stripe
by cron routes (`app/api/cron/stripe-check`, `plans`, `reminders`, `closing`,
`shares`, `usage`, `monthly`, `weekly`). So "a webhook delivered twice" is not
a path today; "a cron run twice, or two runs at once" is.

## Gaps this item closes (units 2 to 7)

1. **Consent records (unit 2 and 414 [KX1]).** No stored record of the
   creator's consent to a plan's recurrence, a plan change or an add-on was
   found; on the store side, consent is recorded for digital delivery only,
   not specifically for memberships, payment plans, gifts, preorders or team
   purchases. Step 2 requires a record with the text's version and time
   before each such charge.
2. **Amounts (unit 2), already held by tests.** Checked on 30 Oct 2026
   (21h05 Fortaleza): the plan checkout sends the published amount for every
   tier and cycle (`billing-trial-policy`); a store checkout sends the
   product's own price with the discount as a separate coupon or promotion
   code that Stripe takes off (`store-sale`: "the price sent is the
   product's; Stripe takes the sale off"; `intro-price`, `fair-price`,
   `code-link`, `offer-journeys`), and bumps, carts, gifts, team purchases,
   tips, payment requests and call packages assert their line amounts
   (`several-bumps`, `cart`, `gifts`, `group-buy`, `store-tips`,
   `payment-requests`, `call-packages`). So unit 2 needs no new rule before a
   charge. What is not held anywhere is the check AFTER the charge: that
   what Stripe actually charged (net of the discount, in the currency shown)
   equals what was sent. That is units 5 and 6. The proration of
   `switchPlan`, `tier-switch` and `yearly-switch` is Stripe's and is
   compared there too.
3. **Idempotency (unit 3).** Writes with no key: every Checkout Session
   (plan, assistant, store, cart, calls, packages, tips, payment requests),
   the subscription updates of `switchPlan`, `tier-switch`, `yearly-switch`,
   `membership-pause` and `share-settle`, `billAddedLinesMonthly`,
   `keepCardThatPays`, subscription and invoice DELETEs, the captions void,
   and coupon creation. Each gets a key derived from what it acts on, so a
   retry or a second run reaches Stripe as the same request.
4. **After an end (unit 4).** Charges after a cancellation, a store's
   closing or a trial's end are stopped by Stripe's own state and by 307
   [EC1]'s guards; open invoices after a plan pause belong to Codex's step-3
   files and are asked of Codex, not edited here.
5. **No daily check exists (units 5 and 6).** Nothing compares the charges of
   the last 48 hours with what the rules expected, and nothing refunds a
   difference on its own outside the store-closing and captions paths.
6. **Tests missing:** `chargeNow` and `createAssistantCheckout` by name,
   `addToNextInvoice`, the pause route, intro, fair and save-offer coupons,
   pay-what-you-want.
7. **Texts (unit 7).** Terms, Refunds and Privacy say nothing yet about a
   daily check or automatic refunds; nothing is promised until the code does
   it (VR).

Nothing here changes a price, a visible limit, the commission,
`PLANS_ON_SALE`, `OPENING_REQUESTED`, the tax gate, Article 9a, the
commercial review or `stripePlatformEligibilityReady`.

## Design of units 5 and 6: the daily check, read from Stripe's own pages

Written before any code, so the code can be tested against it. Stripe pages
read on 30–31 Oct 2026 (about 21h10 Fortaleza): "The Invoice object",
"The Invoice Line Item object", "List all invoices" (the page's own example
sends `Stripe-Version: 2026-10-28.endive`) and the changelog "Replaces
top-level price fields with improved price modeling on Invoice Items and
Invoice Line Items" (2025-03-31.basil).

**Pin the version.** `lib/billing.ts` sends no `Stripe-Version` on most calls,
so it reads whatever the account's default returns (its own comment at
`periodEnd` says so). The check must send one fixed version through
`onPlatformAt` and be tested against that shape only, because the fields it
reads moved in 2025: since 2025-03-31.basil a line has no `price` or `plan`;
the price is `pricing.price_details.price` when `pricing.type` is
`price_details`, and the unit amount is `pricing.unit_amount_decimal`.

**What it reads.** `GET /v1/invoices` on the platform account with
`created[gte]` = now − 48 hours, `status=paid`, `limit=100`, paginated with
`starting_after` (newest first, per the page). Per invoice: `id`, `currency`,
`amount_paid`, `total`, `subtotal`, `total_discount_amounts`, `billing_reason`
(`subscription_create`, `subscription_cycle`, `subscription_update`,
`manual`, …), `status_transitions.paid_at`, `parent` (the subscription), and
`lines` (`has_more` means more lines must be read from `lines.url`, never
assumed absent). Per line: `amount`, `currency`, `subtotal`,
`discount_amounts`, `pricing`, `quantity_decimal`, `period`, and
`parent.subscription_item_details.proration` /
`parent.invoice_item_details.proration` (a proration line is never compared
with a full published price; `discountable` is always false for one).

**What it decides, per paid invoice** (a pure function, tested alone first):

1. `ok` when every line is explained: a subscription line whose unit amount
   is a published or legacy price of `lib/plan.ts` in USD for its cycle; a
   proration line whose amount Stripe computed for a switch the store's
   record shows; a captions or usage line whose key the store's record holds
   (`nl-captions:…`, `nl-<meter>:…`); and `amount_paid` equals `total`, which
   is `subtotal` less `total_discount_amounts` plus tax added on top.
2. `wrong` with the exact difference when it can prove one: a second paid
   invoice for the same subscription and the same period; a charge whose
   `paid_at` is after the subscription ended, the store closed, a pause began
   or a trial ended without conversion; a unit amount above every published
   price for that cycle; another currency than the one shown.
3. `unproven` when a line cannot be explained from the records. The item
   treats it as wrong and refunds it (step 3, "Dúvida"), so unit 6 refunds
   both, but the two are counted apart in the report.
4. Nothing is decided for an invoice it could not read whole (Stripe did not
   answer, lines unreadable): it waits for the next run, never `ok`, never
   refunded.

**Bounds.** Each run has a time budget and a page cap, keeps its place with a
cursor (the last invoice id read and the window it belongs to), and one
invoice that keeps failing is set aside after a fixed number of runs and
reported, so it never blocks the rest. The 48-hour window overlaps the
previous run on purpose; a decision is stored per invoice id, so an invoice
seen twice is decided once.

**Refunds (unit 6).** `POST /v1/refunds` with an idempotency key derived from
the invoice id and the decision, for the difference only, never more than
`amount_paid` less what was already refunded (a disputed or already refunded
charge is read first and left alone), then one email per case, also under a
stored mark, so a retry never refunds or writes twice. Store sales on
creators' accounts are refunded only once the Terms carry the creator's
authorization (step 3 of the item); until then their check runs read-only and
reports. Neither unit is built yet.
