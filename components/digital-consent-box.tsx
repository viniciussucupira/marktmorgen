/**
 * The box a buyer checks before paying for something handed over during the
 * 14-day cancellation period (lib/digital-consent.ts): a real checkbox with
 * its visible label, never checked for them, and required, so the browser
 * itself stops the form and says why, with JavaScript or without. The server
 * checks it again whatever the browser did. `kind` picks the sentence: digital
 * content sold once, or a membership (lib/digital-consent.ts, consentKind).
 *
 * The whole label is the target (at least 44 px high); the note under it is
 * tied to the box by aria-describedby. When the server refused a payment for
 * want of it (`refused`):
 *
 *   - the reason is written beside the box and tied to it by
 *     aria-describedby, and the box is marked invalid, so it reads the same
 *     with scripts off;
 *   - with scripts on, the box takes the focus and the reason is put into a
 *     live region a moment after the page is drawn, so it is announced
 *     rather than sitting in an alert that was there from the start;
 *   - checking the box clears both the mark and the reason.
