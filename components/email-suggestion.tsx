/**
 * The "Did you mean …?" line under an email field (308 [TC1], lib/email-typo.ts).
 *
 * Put it right after the field, give the field `aria-describedby` with this
 * `id`, and pass `show` once the person has left the field or tried to send.
 * The region is always on the page and polite, so a screen reader reads the
 * suggestion when it appears without moving the focus. The button puts the
 * suggested address in the field and gives the focus back to it; nothing is
 * changed without that tap, and nothing stops the form from being sent.
 * Runs in the browser only: no request is made because of it.
