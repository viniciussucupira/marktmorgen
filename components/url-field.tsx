 * A web address field that says what is wrong when the person leaves it or
 * sends its form (487 [IT4], pattern 1; lib/url-check.ts), never while they
 * are still typing, and offers the address with https:// in one press when
 * that is all it lacks. Once said, the message stays as it is while they
 * type, and goes as soon as the address is right; a new problem is said only
 * at the next leave. The save still checks it on the server; this only says
 * so sooner.
 *
 * A text field opening the address keyboard, not type="url": the browser's
 * own bubble would stop the form in other words before this one is seen.
 * No length cut either: an address too long is said, never silently cut.
 *
 * The label is the caller's, tied by `id`, so it stays visible.
