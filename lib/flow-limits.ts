/**
 * The numeric limits of workflows (sequences), in one place, browser-safe, so
 * the studio shows exactly what the server enforces (added 17 October 2026).
 *
 *   - MAX_STEPS: steps in one workflow. Branches only ever jump forward
 *     (lib/flow-paths.ts), so one run visits each step at most once and its
 *     history has a fixed ceiling.
 *   - MAX_FLOWS: workflows a store may keep, paused or active.
 *   - Active workflows by plan: how many may be switched on at once.
 *   - Runs a day by plan: new runs a store may start in one UTC day, across
 *     all its workflows. A start past it is refused before anything is
 *     written for that person, and counted so the studio can say so.
 *
 * Every email a workflow sends is still drawn from the store's monthly email
 * allowance (lib/mail.ts, reserve), before it is sent, and since 17 October
 * 2026 so is its notice to the owner (lib/mail.ts, takeFromMonth). The daily run ceiling
 * bounds what is not email: the database commands each step and its history
 * cost and the webhooks a step queues (lib/webhooks.ts keeps its own retry
 * ceiling).
 *
 * Worst case per run, for the margin review: MAX_STEPS steps, each at most
 * HISTORY_COMMANDS_PER_STEP history commands and QUEUE_COMMANDS_PER_STEP queue
 * and contact commands, plus RUN_START_COMMANDS once. These are ceilings for
 * the review's arithmetic, not measured averages.
