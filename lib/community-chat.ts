/**
 * The room where a community talks at the speed people talk.
 *
 * A feed is for things worth coming back to. A room is for the hour everybody
 * is there at once, and it is the difference between a forum that empties and
 * a place people stay in. Stan has neither a room nor anything like one: posts
 * and comments, with posts that can be scheduled, which is the behaviour of a
 * blog. Circle made its chat spaces work independently of its direct-message
 * switch, which is a company treating chat as infrastructure. Whop built its
 * whole positioning on the room.
 *
 * What Whop documents and nobody else does is the moderation: a mute with a
 * duration, a cooldown between messages, a banned-word list, blocking links
 * and uploads, restricting posting to admins. That is the part worth matching,
 * because an unmoderated room is a room the creator closes after a fortnight.
 *
 * Here: a cooldown the creator sets, links off or on, creator-only when they
 * want the room quiet, and the community's own mute — which already means
 * "reads, does not write" — applying here with nothing extra to learn.
 *
 * Kept under the community's own id:
 *
 *   nl:cm:<id>:ch     the messages, scored by their number (sorted set)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:chn    the counter that numbers them
 *   nl:cm:<id>:chs:<who>  when this person last said something, for the cooldown
 *
 * A sorted set rather than a list, because the room is read by asking "what
 * has happened since number N". A list would mean sending the whole room on
 * every look, a few times a minute, to everybody in it.
 *
 * On what "live" means here, said plainly because the word is usually a lie:
 * the page asks whether anything is new every few seconds while people are
 * talking, twice a minute while the room is quiet (lib/chat-pace.ts), and
 * stops asking while the tab is in the background or nobody has touched the
 * page for a while. There is no socket held open. For a room of people
 * typing, the difference is not something a person can perceive; what it is
 * not is a claim that a message arrives the instant it is sent.
