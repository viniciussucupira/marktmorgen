 * checkout made under them has closed. A checkout whose own hold cannot be
 * confirmed is closed at Stripe, and only Stripe's "expired" lets its units
 * go; without it they stay held and lapse. Any lock not taken opens nothing
 * ("busy"); a count that cannot be read throws, so nothing opens either
 * (unknown never becomes a unit). Each hold is then settled as a single
