/**
 * What discounts did (added 12 October 2026): sales at full price set beside
 * sales with each kind of discount, for the last 90 days — what was given
 * off, how many were refunded, and how many of those buyers bought again —
 * and, for memberships, how long members who joined with a discount stayed
 * beside those who paid in full (lib/membership-numbers.ts, staysBy).
 *
 * Read before it was built: Baremetrics' Revenue Pulse sets discounted
 * revenue beside the rest. Here it is worked out while the sales are read
 * (lib/stats.ts, readSales), from what Stripe already returns on each
 * checkout: the amount its discount took off, and the store's own note of
 * which discount it was. Nothing more is asked of Stripe. Rules the browser
 * can read too.
