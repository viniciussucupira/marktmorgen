/**
 * A store's own map for search engines, and its own rules for crawlers
 * (added 13 October 2026).
 *
 * A store's pages were findable only by following links to them. On a
 * creator's own domain that was worse than it sounds: the domain answered
 * /sitemap.xml and /robots.txt with this site's, which name marktmorgen.com,
 * so the search console a creator opens for their own domain was told the
 * map was somebody else's. Every site builder a creator compares this with
 * makes one per site.
 *
 * What is listed is what the pages themselves tell a search engine to keep,
 * at the address each names as its own (its canonical): the front page while
 * it has something on it, every product a visitor can see, every page of the
 * store that is out, the blog and each published post. Nothing a store keeps
 * back, nothing of a store switched off after notices, and nothing behind a
 * purchase. On a creator's live domain the addresses are the short ones the
 * domain serves; otherwise they are under marktmorgen.com/@handle.
 *
 *   /@handle/sitemap.xml   on every store, and /sitemap.xml on its own domain
 *                          (app/[handle]/store-sitemap, reached through proxy.ts)
 *   /robots.txt            on its own domain only (app/[handle]/store-robots)
