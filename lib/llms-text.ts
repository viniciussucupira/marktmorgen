 * /llms.txt: what an AI agent needs to use Marktmorgen for a creator, in

 *
 * Generated from the code, never written ahead of it (rule VR): the MCP
 * server's tools, with their descriptions and inputs, come from
 * lib/mcp-catalog.ts, the same list the server answers `tools/list` from; the
 * key and rate figures from lib/api-key-rules.ts and lib/api-guard.ts. A tool
 * added to the server appears here in the same change, and one that is not
 * served cannot appear. The REST endpoints are described, field for field,
 * on /developers, which this file points to rather than repeats.
 *
 * Served on this site only. A creator's own domain is the creator's store,
 * not Marktmorgen, so it answers 404 here.

> Marktmorgen is where creators sell digital products, courses, memberships, calls and physical goods from their own store. A creator's AI assistant can read that store's numbers and catalog through Marktmorgen's MCP server, with an API key the creator makes in their studio.

## Connect

- MCP server (Streamable HTTP, JSON, one JSON-RPC message per POST): ${SITE_URL}/api/mcp
- Send the creator's key as the header \`Authorization: Bearer nl_live_…\`. The creator makes it in their studio, under API keys; a store has at most ${MAX_KEYS}, each revocable at once.
- At most ${API_RATE} requests a minute per key. Each request counts in the store's monthly API requests.
- \`initialize\` is answered before a key is read and carries no store's data.
- Money fields are in the smallest unit of the store's currency (cents for USD).

## MCP tools

${allRead ? "Every tool reads only: nothing a tool does changes the store.\n\n" : "Every tool reads only, except those marked as preparing a change: those keep a proposal that the creator reads beside what is there now and confirms in their studio, and nothing on the store changes until they do. They need a key the creator allowed to prepare changes.\n\n"}${tools}

## Privacy

No tool returns a buyer's, member's, subscriber's or affiliate's name, address or words: an assistant's conversation is kept by whoever runs the assistant, and the people on a creator's list never agreed to be read there. Affiliates appear by their link's code.

## More

- [Developers](${SITE_URL}/developers): every REST endpoint under /api/v1, with keys, limits and example responses.
- [Help](${SITE_URL}/help): how creators use the studio.
