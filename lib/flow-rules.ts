/**
 * Conditions in a sequence (added 11 October 2026): an email sent only to
 * some of the people in it, and a sequence that ends for somebody once it has
 * done its job.
 *
 * Until now a sequence sent every email to everyone in it. So the emails that
 * sell — "the course opens Friday", "last day of the launch price" — went on
 * to the people who had already bought the course, which costs a creator
 * trust and money, and a creator who wanted one email for buyers and another
 * for everybody else had to keep two sequences and hope.
 *
 * Two things now:
 *
 *   - An end ("goal"): the sequence stops for anyone who gets one product,
 *     or buys anything at all. Checked before each of its emails.
 *   - A condition on an email: send it only to those who got a product, or
 *     have not; who have bought something, or have not yet; who carry a
 *     label, or do not. Anyone it does not hold for skips that email and
 *     goes on to the next one, or leaves the sequence there, as the creator
 *     chooses.
 *
 * Read from what the list has always kept about each person: what they
 * asked for or bought, how they first agreed, and the labels an import
 * brought (lib/contacts.ts). And one more, only for somebody who allowed it
 * with a box of its own: whether they used a link to the store in the email
 * before this one (lib/mail-clicks.ts). Somebody who did not allow it counts
 * as not having used one. Never from opens: there is no tracking pixel.
 *
 * And, from 12 October 2026, what somebody did in a course: whether they
 * opened it at all, and whether they finished it (every lesson done),
 * read from the course's own record of its students (lib/learn.ts). With a
 * wait before it, "has not opened the course" is the reminder three days
 * after buying; a sequence that starts when somebody finishes a course
 * (lib/flows.ts, trigger "finished") is the offer of the next one.
 *
 * Browser-safe.
