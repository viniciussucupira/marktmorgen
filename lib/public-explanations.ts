/**
 * One explanation, read from the code, for things the public pages describe
 * in more than one place (389 [TB15]).
 *
 * The blog and the comparison pages used to explain the same thing in their
 * own words, and drifted: the blog said PayPal was missing because Stripe
 * does not support it for direct charges, while the comparisons said it was
 * built and waiting on PayPal's approval; the blog said affiliates are not
 * paid automatically, while the comparisons said they are, from the
 * creator's own PayPal on payday; the Stan table said a checkout cannot ask
 * for a phone number, which it can since 11 October 2026. Each sentence here
 * is made from the setting or the list it describes, so the pages say the same
 * thing and change on the day the code does.
 *
 * Pure: it reads the environment and two constant lists, nothing else. The
 * blog module is also imported by a client component (components/blog-browser.tsx),
 * so this must not pull the PayPal client, Redis or email in.
