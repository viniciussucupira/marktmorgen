That page has its own title and preview card, so a link to one product shared anywhere unfolds into that product. Rename the product and its address follows; every link shared before keeps working.

Your studio shows the last 7, 30 or 90 days, or all time: visitors, page views, checkouts started, sales, revenue and conversion, renewals of memberships and payment plans apart from new sales, where your visitors came from, and each product and link on its own line, with how many times each product's page was opened and how many sales every 100 of those views brought. The payment comparison shows equal consecutive 7- or 30-day UTC periods within the complete 90-day ledger, including the current day as recorded so far. It includes channels with payments only now or only before. Payment change needs previous payments; share change is in percentage points and requires payments in both periods. Missing prior coverage stays unavailable, including a previous 90-day period that does not fit the ledger. Download CSV or ask your numbers assistant. Amounts include renewals and are gross before refunds, fees and ads, not new customers, profit or causal marketing lift. The payment mix panel shows the largest identified channel, the top three and payments without an identified marketing channel. All shares divide by all recorded payments in the selected UTC days, including renewals at their recorded subscription channel. Direct or unknown, pre-tracking sales and imported origins are excluded from the identified-channel ranking but remain in its denominator and the breakdown. Download payment shares as CSV or ask your numbers assistant. Complete ledger coverage is required; no payments means shares cannot be calculated. Amounts are gross before refunds, fees and ads, not acquisition shares, profit or proof of advertising lift. The numbers assistant and connected funnel/product reports use complete purchase readings for paid totals and paid conversion rates. A successful but partial reading is identified as incomplete, not a provider failure or zero sales. Traffic and checkouts remain available; product rankings use page views when paid amounts are unavailable, and paid-derived alerts wait for complete figures. Channel reports sent to connected assistants include explicit paid-figure coverage. Incomplete purchase readings withhold paid totals, attribution and variant results while traffic counts can remain available. First-visit no-channel amounts are included separately; older missing first-visit details stay null. Variant results describe paid records, not unique buyers, and disclose the 25-row limit and total variant count when available. Missing variant details remain unavailable even if the purchase reading succeeded. The attribution comparison keeps no-channel amounts separately for first and last visits and downloads as CSV. Do not add alternative visit columns or buyer answers to revenue: answers cover respondents and belong to the day answered. Older readings without first-visit no-channel figures show unavailable rather than zero. Comparisons, downloads and assistant figures wait for complete purchase readings. Under Share, choose the link type for an organic post, email campaign or paid ad, name the campaign and optionally name an ad or link variant. The generated address replaces existing attribution tags instead of duplicating them, preserves other query values and page anchors, and displays the normalized names used in the reports. Names are limited to 40 characters. Reuse the same campaign tag in ad-spend records. Paid variant records are grouped by channel, campaign and variant together, so an ad name reused in another campaign or channel does not merge different ads. Download all variant results as CSV: every row in the selected UTC period is included, even beyond the first 15 displayed, with dates, currency and definitions. Variant totals, downloads and assistant amounts wait for complete purchase readings. These records include purchases and one-click extras, not unique buyers, and their gross amounts are before refunds and fees with renewals excluded. Search the campaign table by campaign name or recorded payment/ad channel, ignoring case and accents. Sort by visits, paid records, gross amount, recorded ads, gross less ads (highest or lowest first), or name. Unknown values sort last when ordering by that numeric metric. Download displayed campaigns to export the current search and order with filter metadata; the full campaign download includes every campaign. Untagged ad spend stays a whole-report figure even in a filtered view. The campaign table combines the same utm_campaign tag across channels and shows the recorded payment and ad channels separately. Visits belong to the campaign tag as a whole and are not assigned to payment channels. Paid records include purchases and one-click extras, not unique buyers; renewals are excluded. Campaigns with recorded ad spend remain visible even without visits or paid records. Ad spend without a campaign tag is disclosed separately, never guessed into rows. Gross amount less recorded ads is before refunds and all other costs, not profit or proof of advertising lift. Incomplete paid readings stay unknown. Download the report as CSV or ask your numbers assistant. The daily result table shows payments, including renewals, recorded refunds including pending refunds, recorded ads and what remains for each UTC day. Multi-day ad entries are allocated evenly using cumulative rounding so daily amounts sum to their recorded total, including every smallest currency unit. Complete daily payment and refund records are required; missing figures stay unknown. Refunds can relate to earlier purchases, and the result is before fees, tax, commissions and other costs, not profit or advertising lift. Download these figures as CSV or ask your numbers assistant about them. The refund activity table shows recorded refunds by channel, including pending refunds, beside payments received in the same days, including renewals. The amount ratio can exceed 100% because refunded purchases may have been earlier; it is not the percentage of purchases or buyers refunded. With no payments, the ratio stays unknown. Refund records are not unique buyers or orders. Only complete, matched readings produce this table and its alerts, and it downloads as CSV. The weekly repurchase table groups buyers by the UTC Monday of their first observed purchase, using up to 180 days of history independently of the selected period. It shows cumulative repeat purchases within 7, 30, 60 and 90 days, with only buyers observed for the full period in each denominator; young cohorts show a dash instead of zero. Renewals and one-click extras do not count, incomplete history is disclosed, and these are observed purchases, not activity retention or lifetime acquisition. Download the table as CSV or ask your numbers assistant about it. The channel result and buyer-channel panels also download the selected days as CSV files with dates, currency and coverage notes, without buyer identities. Unknown results and rates stay blank; negative results stay numeric. Sales, visits day by day and sources each download as a CSV file; a sales file holds up to 5,000 sales and says so when there are more.",

Four templates start you off: a newsletter, something new, a welcome and one product. A template only lays out blocks, with what to write in ⟦brackets⟧, and an email still holding one cannot go out. Both ways write the same email, so you can switch between them at any time.",

          "A sequence can also split its people in two, A and B: an email set to the first half goes only to them, one set to the second half only to the others, and each person stays in the same half at every step, so you can try two versions of a sequence on one list. A step can also tell your own server, through your webhooks, who reached it, once for each person.",
          `A sequence is also a workflow. Any step can branch, IF/ELSE: those its condition holds for do it and go on to a later step you choose, the others go to another later step or leave. A step can only wait, which with a condition makes a pure branch, or make a teammate responsible for the person's open deal. A workflow can end once someone buys, gets one product or carries a label, and it can start when someone opens a course for the first time, or when someone on your list leaves a checkout unpaid after checking the box on the checkout page to hear from you (that box is Stripe's, shown to stores with a US Stripe account; such a workflow must end once they buy). New workflows are saved paused: preview the path someone would take, then switch it on. Every run keeps its history for up to 400 days, each step attempted, then confirmed, failed or uncertain; an uncertain step is never repeated by itself, and the run waits for you to choose. When someone asks to be deleted, one press in a run's history erases them from every workflow: their runs, history and steps still waiting. Removing a workflow or deleting the store erases its runs too. ${workflowLimitWords()} Every email a workflow sends counts in your monthly emails.`,

Wait three days after the purchase, send only to those who have not opened it, and the reminder reaches exactly the people who need it.",

These are worked out from your own Stripe account when the email goes out, so they match buyers only, and nothing extra is recorded about anyone.

Start from another of your products' pages (its blocks and words are copied, its pictures stay with it), from one of six templates, from a draft written with AI on " + AI_PLANS_WORDS + " (which, for a PDF, can read its first ten pages first, so what is inside comes from the real contents), or from nothing, and drag the blocks into the order you want. Translate the whole page with AI into any of the store languages in one step; names, numbers and prices stay as they are, and nothing is saved until you press Save. Add a block from a gallery grouped by what it does, at the end or right between two others, keep one to phones or to computers and tablets, or duplicate one to start the next from it. The page as it was before each of your last five saves is kept under Earlier versions for as long as the page is, counted in your store's data room, so a save can be taken back; while you edit, Undo and Redo (Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Shift+Z) go back and forward a step at a time. On a wide screen the page is drawn beside its blocks, as visitors will see it on a phone, and redrawn as you type; press a part of it to open that block. In the reviews block you can pick up to three of your buyers' verified reviews to show first; each is marked as picked by you, and the average and the count stay those of every review. Keep it from visitors while you work on it (they see the product's plain page) and show it when it is ready, or have it show by itself at a moment you set. Choose its style: plain, in bands (every other section on a soft wash of your store's color) or in cards. It has its own title and description for search engines, and a share picture drawn from the product's picture, name, price and stars.

Once saved, half your visitors read each, kept to the same one by a cookie.

It is a private Jitsi Meet room made for the event, which members open inside the page or in a tab of its own, your own meeting link, or a Google Meet made on your connected Google Calendar: one meeting with nobody on its guest list, so members ask to join and you let them in. Emails, calendar files and the feed point to the page, never to the room. Members who asked for the community's emails get a reminder a day and an hour before; a move or a cancellation is emailed once to everyone coming; and, if you have turned on phone notifications, you get one 15 minutes before.

Each affiliate is paid at the email address they joined with; the book says paid once PayPal confirms it, anyone PayPal cannot pay stays owed, and nobody is sent twice. PayPal charges you its own fee on each payment. A PayPal account in Brazil can only send these payments in reais, to Brazil, so it cannot pay through us. Without PayPal, download the batch for PayPal or Wise, or pay however you agree, and mark it paid. On Stan, affiliates are paid out of your sale, which Stan holds for 7 business days first.",

Memberships and payment plans earn only if you choose: a membership on its first payment, on every payment in its first 3, 6, 12 or 24 months, or for as long as the member pays, read from your Stripe account as each one is paid; a payment plan on each of its payments. A membership keeps the terms it was sold with. The last affiliate link a buyer followed wins, and nobody earns on their own purchase, even from their address written another way.",

Two checks hold commission before it is paid: two affiliates sharing an inbox or payout address, and, unless you allow it, an affiliate's link reached from a paid search ad on your name. What is held is left out of every payment until you look and release it. Visits and sales through affiliate links show as their own channel, Affiliates, in your numbers.",

It goes one level only, everything promised on one sale, partners' shares included, never passes 90%, it follows refunds like any commission, and it waits while the person they brought is held.
