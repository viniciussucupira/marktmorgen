/**
 * A creator's discount code put on one member's running membership, from the
 * studio (616 [WP15](8); owner's Whop audit). Everything happens on the
 * creator's own Stripe account: the code is one of theirs (lib/discount.ts),
 * the membership is theirs, and Stripe keeps applying the code's own rules
 * (how long it lasts, a first order only, its minimum), refusing it when
 * they do not fit. Marktmorgen takes nothing and charges nothing here.
 *
 * Read again on the server at the moment of applying, never taken from the
 * page: the member by their address, the membership among this store's live
 * ones of theirs, and the code among the store's active ones. A membership
 * that already has a discount is refused rather than having it replaced
 * without a word: a better one could be lost.
 *
 * Stripe's answers are read in their exact shape (CX-123 rules 24 and 30,
 * lib/stripe-list.ts): a list that is not a whole, readable list is "could
 * not check" ("unreadable"), never "no running membership"; a `discounts`
 * that is not Stripe's own shape is "not known", and the code is not put on,
 * since putting it on would replace whatever is there.
