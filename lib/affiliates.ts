/**
 * A creator's affiliates: people who send buyers to the store and earn a
 * share of what those buyers pay.
 *
 * The one rule this file is built around: Marktmorgen never holds, moves or pays
 * out any of this money. Every sale is paid to the creator's own Stripe
 * account, in full, like every other sale here. What is kept is the record —
 * who applied, who the creator let in, which sale came through whose link,
 * what that earns and what the creator says they have paid — and the creator
 * pays their affiliates themselves, however they like. The studio says so,
 * and so does every page an affiliate sees.
 *
 * How a sale is credited:
 *
 *   - an affiliate's link is the store's address with ?via=<code>. Following
 *     it leaves a first-party cookie on the store's own address (proxy.ts)
 *     holding the code and the time. The last link followed wins;
 *   - when the buyer opens a checkout within the store's window, and the code
 *     belongs to someone the creator approved, the affiliate and the share
 *     the product earns today travel with the charge in its metadata. Only
 *     one-off payments are credited: memberships and payment plans are not;
 *   - once Stripe says the checkout is settled, the sale is written down here
 *     with what was paid before tax, read from Stripe. The thanks page and
 *     the five-minute job both do this, so a buyer who never comes back is
 *     still counted, and each sale is written once;
 *   - what it earns is worked out when it is shown, against the refunds on
 *     the creator's Stripe account, so a refunded sale earns nothing and a
 *     partly refunded one earns on what was kept. A chargeback counts the
 *     same way (added 17 October 2026): while the bank holds the disputed
 *     money, and for good once the dispute is lost, that money was not kept,
 *     so it earns nothing; a dispute the creator wins earns again;
 *   - a membership or a payment plan, where the creator credits them (added
 *     12 October 2026, lib/affiliate-setting.ts recurring), carries the
 *     affiliate on its subscription, and each of its paid invoices is read
 *     from the creator's Stripe account when the book is: a membership's
 *     while it is within the months agreed when it was sold, a plan's every
 *     one. Nothing is written for them here;
 *   - a bonus for each goal reached in a calendar month is worked out from
 *     the same lines, so a refund that takes the month back under the goal
 *     takes the bonus back too.
 *
 * What stops it being gamed:
 *
 *   - nobody earns on their own purchase: a sale paid with the affiliate's own
 *     address is written down as such and earns nothing, and a browser signed
 *     in as that affiliate is not credited at all;
 *   - the creator cannot be their own affiliate;
 *   - a click counts once per visitor per day, clicks from one connection are
 *     capped per hour, and the creator's own clicks and known robots are not
 *     counted;
 *   - two affiliates paid at the same address, or signing up with the same
 *     inbox written two ways (a "+" tag, Gmail's dots), and an affiliate
 *     whose link was reached from a paid search ad where the creator does
 *     not allow those, have what they are owed held, out of every payment,
 *     until the creator looks and releases it;
 *   - a purchase paid from the affiliate's inbox written another way is
 *     their own purchase all the same;
 *   - applying needs the address to be real — the application only exists
 *     once its emailed link is opened — and is capped per hour, per
 *     connection and per address.
 *   - where the creator lets buyers join on their own, the proof is the
 *     order itself: the checkout's id, which only the thanks page and the
 *     purchase email carry, is read back from the creator's Stripe account,
 *     and the address that paid is the one that joins.
 *
 * Records, under the store's own stats id so they move with the store:
 *
 *   nl:aff:<id>:people   hash  affiliate id -> the affiliate
 *   nl:aff:<id>:emails   hash  address -> affiliate id
 *   nl:aff:<id>:codes    hash  code -> affiliate id
 *   nl:aff:<id>:clicks   hash  affiliate id -> clicks counted
 *   nl:aff:<id>:paid     hash  affiliate id -> clicks counted that came from a paid search ad
 *   nl:aff:<id>:sales    hash  Stripe reference -> the sale
 *   nl:aff:<id>:payouts  hash  payout id -> what the creator says they paid
