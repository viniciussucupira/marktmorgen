/**
 * A store whose plan has ended, and what it still keeps.
 *
 * lib/plan-standing.ts gives a store with no plan room for five gigabytes.
 * A store whose plan ends may be keeping far more than that, put there
 * while it paid, and it goes on costing us to keep for as long as it is
 * kept: up to four dollars a month, for ever, for a store that pays
 * nothing. Nothing else here costs anything once a plan has ended.
 *
 * So what such a store keeps past the room of a store with no plan has a
 * date on it, and the date is said three times before it comes. Since 18
 * October 2026 that room is none for a plan that ends from that day on
 * (lib/plan-closing-rules.ts, keptRoomFor): everything such a store keeps
 * has the date, students' hand-ins and community pictures included, so no
 * store goes on costing us for ever once nobody pays for it.
 *
 *   - Nothing happens to a store that keeps no more than its room: none
 *     for a plan ended from 18 October 2026, a store with no plan's before.
 *   - One that keeps more has CLOSING_DAYS from the day its plan ended. Its
 *     owner is written to when the plan ends, WARN_MONTH_DAYS before the
 *     date and WARN_WEEK_DAYS before it, each time with the figures, the
 *     date, and the two ways out: start a plan again, or delete enough to
 *     fit.
 *   - On the date, what it keeps is removed (removeStored): the files its
 *     products hand over, its lessons' videos and downloads, its podcast's
 *     episodes. The store itself is not touched: its page, its products and
 *     prices, its lessons' text and quizzes, its contacts and its orders
 *     all stay, and a file can be put back on a product the day a plan is
 *     started again.
 *
 * This is the one thing in this codebase that deletes what a creator put
 * here without being asked to, so it is hedged every way it can be:
 *
 *   - never before the last notice has been out for a full week. A notice
 *     that could not be sent moves the date; it is not skipped;
 *   - never on our own note that the plan is over. Stripe is asked, that
 *     day, whether the store has a subscription in good standing, and if it
 *     has, the note is put right and nothing is removed;
 *   - never when the store cannot be measured, emailed or checked: each of
 *     those is a reason to do nothing that day, and try the next;
 *   - one store at a time, by the daily job, with what it did written down.
 *
 * Since 18 October 2026 a plan that ends closes the whole store on that
 * day (lib/plan-closing-rules.ts, closesStore), whether it keeps files or
 * not: the same three notices, the same week after the last and the same
 * check with Stripe, and then, that day, its files are removed, the
 * renewals of what it sold are stopped at Stripe (lib/closed-store-data.ts,
 * stopRenewals), and it is put in line for the walk that deletes every
 * record it keeps in the database (lib/closed-store-data.ts), which runs
 * within the hour. Nothing of its sales is copied anywhere: they are on the
 * creator's own Stripe account, which is where a seller's records of them
 * are (docs/tax-uncertainty.md, question 13). A plan that ended before that
 * day keeps the rule above.
 *
 *   nl:plan:ended            the stores whose plan has ended, by the day
 *   nl:plan:closing:<key>    what a store was told and when; when removed,
 *                            and when its records were deleted
 *   nl:plan:closing:after    where a run that ran out of time stopped
 *
 * A store with no plan cannot add to what it keeps past its room
 * (lib/storage-quota.ts, fits), so one that was found to fit is not measured
 * again for RECHECK_DAYS: measuring is the dear part of a look, and nearly
 * every store whose plan ended fits.
