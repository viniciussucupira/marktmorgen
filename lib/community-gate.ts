/**
 * Which spaces of a community a member can see, as one pure decision
 * (399 [SL3], unit 1; added 1 November 2026): the rule lib/community-access.ts
 * applies with the member's real purchases (maySeeSpace, visibleSpaces), and
 * the creator's "View as a member" applies with purchases the creator picks
 * for the preview. One rule, so the preview can never show something a real
 * member would not see, or hide something they would.
 *
 *   - a space kept for nobody in particular is open to every member;
 *   - a space kept for some products opens to a member who holds one of
 *     them, among those that still open the community (a product taken off
 *     the community's own list is ignored, so it shuts nobody out);
 *   - the creator sees every space.
 *
 * The preview's holdings are only the product ids the creator chose: no
 * buyer's identity, address, purchases or token is read or used, and
 * nothing is asked of Stripe for it.
 *
 * Browser-safe: plain data and pure functions.
