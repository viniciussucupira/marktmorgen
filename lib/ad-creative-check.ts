/**
 * Whether an ad's words may be sent to an ad platform: 632 [AA2] (c), unit 2
 * (owner, 2 November 2026, 02h17 Fortaleza). The owner's rule for ads made
 * here: "com os filtros de honestidade existentes (nada de promessa de ganho,
 * escassez ou depoimento inventado)".
 *
 * The same honesty rules the store already holds its own words to
 * (lib/terms-check-rules.ts, checkCreatorTerms), applied to every line of an
 * ad (headline, main text, description, button words), and stricter, because
 * an ad reaches people who never chose to read the creator:
 *
 *   - a promise of fast or easy money, or of earnings, income or results, is
 *     refused, not only warned;
 *   - urgency or scarcity is refused unless the store really has the deadline
 *     (a sale with an end) or the stock limit behind it;
 *   - a price in the ad that is not the product's price is refused;
 *   - a quoted testimonial ("…" — Name) is refused unless its words are, word
 *     for word, one of the store's own verified reviews passed in;
 *   - another company's name or address is a warning: ads naming other
 *     brands are often refused by the platforms, and the creator decides.
 *
 * Not checked here, on purpose: each platform's own published ad policies
 * (before-and-after, health, finance, AI-content labels) and their length
 * limits: only what the official check confirmed may become a rule
 * (docs/ad-platforms-official-check-2026-11-02.md), and Meta's texts were not
 * readable there, so they are listed in `notChecked`, never assumed. Pure;
 * nothing is sent.
