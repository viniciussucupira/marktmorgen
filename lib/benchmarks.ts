/**
 * Where the samples of stores' rates are kept, and the ranges made from them
 * (lib/benchmark-rules.ts says what they are). A store's sample is written
 * when its numbers are read anyway — the studio's page, the weekly email —
 * never on a visit to the store; the ranges are worked out once a day from
 * the last two weeks' samples, and the studio only reads that one record.
 *
 * What a sample holds: the store's band and four rates, with nothing that
 * names the store but the field it is kept under, which is the store's
 * counter id and never shown. What anyone is shown is a band's middle half
 * and median, made from at least MIN_STORES stores. The demo store and a
 * suspended store are never in it.
 *
 *   nl:bench:s:<monday>   hash: <statsId> → the store's sample that week, three weeks
 *   nl:bench:ranges       the ranges, a month
