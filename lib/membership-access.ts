/**
 * Membership access that ends when the membership does.
 *
 * A membership is paid for as it goes, so what it hands over — its file, its
 * course — is open while it is being paid for and closed once it is not.
 * Until this existed the thanks-page link of a membership kept its file open
 * for its three days whatever happened to the membership meanwhile. Now every
 * delivery a membership makes through Marktmorgen asks Stripe first:
 *
 *   - a download from the thanks page or the emailed list of purchases reads
 *     the checkout from the creator's own account on every request, as it
 *     always did, and now reads the membership's state in that same request;
 *   - a course page, lesson or lesson download reads it through lib/learn.ts,
 *     which keeps Stripe's answer for ten minutes;
 *   - anything else that only has the membership's id asks for it here, and
 *     the answer is kept for two minutes.
 *
 * Open means Stripe calls the membership active, in its free trial, or past
 * due — a payment failed and Stripe is still retrying it, which is the
 * member's grace, not a reason to lock them out mid-retry. Anything else —
 * cancelled, unpaid after the retries, paused (by Stripe, or by a pause the
 * member chose, memberState), a first payment never made —
 * is ended, and the member is shown a page that says so plainly, with the
 * way to join again and, where a card can be fixed, the way to fix it.
 *
 * A membership that ends by itself after a set number of payments has ended
 * too, once the last period is over: that is what the creator sold.
 *
 * What this cannot reach is a link to somewhere else. A product delivered as
 * a link to a Google Drive folder, a Notion page or a private video is on
 * somebody else's server; once the member has the address they have it, and
 * only the creator can take it back there. The studio says so beside that
 * choice.
