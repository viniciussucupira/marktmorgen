/**
 * Time members paid for past a store's closing day, given back from the
 * creator's own Stripe account (queue item 307 [EC1], part 4, and its
 * complement of 30 October 2026, 13h12 Fortaleza).
 *
 * Two ways in, one calculation (lib/closing-buyers-rules.ts, unusedOf and
 * stillToGive) and one function:
 *
 *   - the creator's button, after a review screen (app/studio/closing-refunds):
 *     every member's amount shown before it is confirmed, and refused if what
 *     Stripe says changed since the screen was drawn;
 *   - the closing day (lib/plan-closing.ts): whatever was not given back by
 *     then is given back that day, the same amounts, by the code.
 *
 * Read on 30 October 2026 in Stripe's documentation:
 * docs.stripe.com/connect/saas/tasks/refunds-disputes ("Create a refund using
 * your platform's secret key with charge_write permission for connected
 * accounts when authenticated as the connected account"; "With direct
 * charges ... Stripe debits refunds and disputed amounts from that account's
 * balance"); docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances (a connected account's
 * negative balance can fall on the platform when controller.losses.payments
 * is "application"); docs.stripe.com/errors (balance_insufficient,
 * charge_disputed, refund_disputed_payment, charge_already_refunded);
 * docs.stripe.com/changelog/basil/2025-04-30/refund-pending-reason (a refund
 * pending for insufficient_funds).
 *
 * So the platform never pays and never owes: each refund is made only when
 * the account's available balance in that currency, read first, covers it,
 * and is counted off as it goes; one that does not fit is not attempted.
 *
 * Never twice: each refund carries the invoice it gives back for in its
 * metadata and in its idempotency key; before one is made Stripe is asked
 * for the refunds already made on that payment, and whatever was given back
 * already (here, by the creator at Stripe, for any reason) is taken off the
 * unused part (stillToGive). A lock keeps two requests from running at once.
