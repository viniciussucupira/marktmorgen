/**
 * Telling a member, once, that their renewal did not go through — with a link
 * that actually recovers it.
 *
 * Nobody tells them otherwise. Stripe retries a failed card on its own
 * schedule, and it can email the member itself, but only if the creator has
 * found and switched on that setting in their own Stripe dashboard, which
 * most never do. So a member whose card expired is quietly retried against
 * the same dead card for two weeks and then cut off, never having been asked
 * for a new one. That is a member lost who never chose to leave.
 *
 * The link is the part that was easy to get wrong, and checked against
 * Stripe's own documentation before anything was written:
 *
 *   - Stripe retries a subscription on its OWN default card first, before the
 *     customer's. The portal's "update card" flow changes only the
 *     customer's. So a member who updated their card there would watch Stripe
 *     go on retrying the dead one — a fix that fixes nothing.
 *   - The invoice's own hosted page pays that very invoice, now, with
 *     whatever card is typed. It is Stripe's page and Stripe's checkout.
 *   - A subscription with `payment_settings.save_default_payment_method` set
 *     to `on_subscription` makes whatever card pays an invoice its new
 *     default, per Stripe's documentation. So that is set first.
 *
 * Together: the money that failed is paid, and the next renewal uses the card
 * that worked. Nothing depends on which default Checkout happened to set.
 *
 * Once per invoice, unless the creator chooses more (added 12 October 2026,
 * lib/dunning-rules.ts): two or three emails, the later ones 3 and 7 days
 * after the first, each only while that same payment is still unpaid. Once
 * is the default because a second and third email about the same payment can
 * read as a debt collector; a creator who knows their members chooses.
 *
 * And before a payment fails at all: when the card a membership is paid with
 * stops working before its next payment, the member is told some days ahead,
 * once per card, with a page that puts a new card on that membership
 * (lib/card-update.ts). On unless the creator switches it off.
 *
 * Checked in the daily job rather than as it happens, because this app
 * receives no events from Stripe — it asks, as every other sweep here does. A
 * member hears within a day of the failure, and nothing needs setting up in
 * anybody's Stripe dashboard for it to work.
