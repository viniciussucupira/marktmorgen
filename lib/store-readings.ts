/**
 * A store's readings of its own numbers from its Stripe account and its
 * counts (C4-4; the owner's decision of 4 November 2026, inbox C4-18): its
 * days of visits (lib/stats.ts, readStats), its sales, renewals, refunds and
 * disputes (readSales) and its memberships (lib/membership-numbers.ts).
 *
 * The page that shows them still costs what the Terms say a studio page
 * costs, STUDIO_PAGE_UNITS of the studio's requests, and nothing more of that
 * figure: what a reading costs past it comes from a budget of the store's own,
 * STORE_READINGS_PER_DAY a UTC day, counted before Stripe or the counts are
 * read, priced in its own line (tests/plan-cost-registry.ts, store-readings).
 * What was read is kept READING_FRESH_SECONDS for every page that shows it
 * (the studio's home, the totals of every store), so looking again does not
 * read again; and kept READING_KEEP_SECONDS more, so that when the day's
 * readings are used the last one is shown rather than nothing: sales so kept
 * are marked as not read in full, so the pages say what they already say of
 * such a reading (that the sales may be lower than they are); visits so kept
 * are at most a day old. A reading larger than READING_COPY_MAX_BYTES is not
 * kept.
 *
 *   nl:reading:<kind>:<statsId>       { at, value }, a day
 *   nl:reading:day:<statsId>:<day>    the day's readings, two days
 *   nl:reading:day:<statsId>:<day>:heavy   of them, the heavy ones
 *
 * A reading kept is shown as it is, with the time it was read, never as an
 * incomplete one (inbox C4-33): the page says when it was read, offers to
 * read again while the day has a reading left, and once they are used says
 * when they come back, at 00:00 UTC.
