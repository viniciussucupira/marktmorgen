 *     the studio. Nothing about what was handed in: they read it there.
 *   - The student, by email, when the creator approves their work or asks
 *     for another try: what the creator wrote, in the store's language, and
 *     the way back to the lesson. Sent from the store's name, as every
 *     course email is (lib/learn.ts, courseSender).
