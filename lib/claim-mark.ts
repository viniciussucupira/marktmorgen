 * back: the key holding our own value means the write landed and the mark is
 * ours; holding another value, it is somebody else's; anything else (absent,
 * unreadable) is unknown, so nothing is done on it this run and nothing is
 * let go, since it is not ours to let go.

 * The value starts with the time in milliseconds, so a reader that takes the
 * mark's value as the time it was taken (lib/payment-recovery.ts) still reads
 * it: `Number("1730000000000.123456789")` is that time.
