/**
 * A whole funnel drafted with AI (added 17 October 2026), as rules the
 * studio's browser reads too. The part that asks the model is
 * lib/funnel-ai.ts; the structures it fills are the guided setup's own
 * (lib/funnel-types.ts, lib/funnel-page-copy.ts, lib/funnel-form-draft.ts),
 * so a drafted funnel is created by the same route, with the same checks, as
 * one typed by hand: hidden pages, a disabled funnel, nothing published.
 *
 * ClickFunnels' "Build with AI" writes a funnel from a conversation and has a
 * research mode that proposes an audience. What this one adds for a creator
 * who has to stand behind every word:
 *
 *   - It drafts from the creator's own records: the products chosen for each
 *     step, as saved, with their real prices; the audience, offer and proof
 *     typed in the box. It never invents a testimonial, a result, a number, a
 *     deadline or a quantity left, and a sentence carrying a number that none
 *     of those facts carries is removed before the creator sees it.
 *   - Where a fact only the creator has is needed, the draft says so in a
 *     placeholder ⟦like this⟧. A page still holding one cannot be shown to
 *     visitors (app/api/store/site-page), and a sequence still holding one
 *     cannot be saved (lib/flows.ts), so a direction is never published as
 *     the creator's words.
 *   - The research mode reads only the store's own dated records, never the
 *     web, and every statement it keeps cites one of them.
 *   - What it costs is said before it runs, in the same monthly AI uses as
 *     every other draft, weighted by each request's spending hold
 *     (funnelDraftJobs); each request also reserves that hold from the
 *     plan's monthly AI budget before it is sent (lib/ai.ts, askModel).
 *
 * Pure and browser-safe.
