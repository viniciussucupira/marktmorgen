 *
 * Why an index and not a scan. The only way to enumerate stores is
 * `storesAfter`, a SCAN over the whole keyspace in pages of two hundred keys.
 * That is right for a nightly job and wrong for a page: every store carries
 * dozens of keys of its own — statistics, affiliates, codes, buyer bonds — so
 * a directory page built on a scan would spend thousands of Redis commands per
 * visit, and Upstash charges by the command. So the answer is kept rather than
 * discovered: a set written the moment a creator turns the consent on, and
 * unwritten the moment they turn it off, and the page reads that one set.
 *
 * The consent was collected before the directory opened, asked in the future
 * tense ("if one opens"), so the creators who said yes then are the ones it
 * opened with.
 *
 *   nl:dir:listed   set  the sid of every store whose creator said yes
 *   nl:dir:page     the directory's rows, kept a few minutes; dropped on every save
