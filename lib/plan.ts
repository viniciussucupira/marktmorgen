 *   2. Every checkout that charges on a creator's account sets that fee, and
 *      a refund gives back the fee's share of what was refunded. Built on
 *      October 12, 2026 (lib/platform-share.ts, lib/share-settle.ts), and
 *      to be run against Stripe's test mode on that company's platform
 *      before it is relied on (SHARE_PROVED_IN_TEST_MODE there).

 *      subscribed before keeps the price it chose with no share taken
 *      (Store.shared), which is built.

 * tests/plan-margin.test.ts refuses the switch while any of these is
