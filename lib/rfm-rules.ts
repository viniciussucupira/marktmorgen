/**
 * Buyers in groups by how recently and how often they bought, with what they
 * spent beside it (270 [GR1], unit 1; added 1 November 2026): the classic
 * recency, frequency and value, read only from the store's own sales (the
 * buyers' ledger, lib/segments.ts) and never from anyone else's data.
 *
 * Each group says its own rule in plain words, so the creator sees exactly
 * who is in it and why. The groups do not overlap and do not guess: nothing
 * here predicts what anybody will spend. A buyer brought over from another
 * platform has no purchase here, so is in none of them.
 *
 * Not yet counted, so no group is shown or used until they are (unit 2,
 * on the queue): a membership's or a payment plan's later payments (the
 * ledger reads checkouts and offers after paying, not renewals), so a member
 * who pays every month would read as quiet since joining; and refunds, so a
 * purchase given back still counts. The ledger can also be partial (a
 * reading reaches so far back); the panel says so when it is.
 *
 * Browser-safe: plain data and pure functions.
