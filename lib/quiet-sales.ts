/**
 * The email when sales stop (added 11 October 2026): a store that sells
 * regularly and has gone clearly longer than usual without a sale.
 *
 * The busy-day email (lib/stats-report.ts) says when things go well; this
 * says when they may have broken. A checkout that stopped opening, a product
 * hidden by mistake, a Stripe account that asks for something, a link in a
 * bio that points at the wrong page: each looks, from the creator's side,
 * exactly like a quiet week, and is found out a week or a month later. Matomo
 * sells alerts on any figure for this reason; here it is the one figure that
 * is money.
 *
 * When. The store's usual pace is its sales over the last 60 days. At that
 * pace, the chance of a stretch of `d` days with none is e^(−pace × d); the
 * email goes when that is under one in a hundred, after at least two days,
 * and only for a store with at least QUIET_MIN_SALES sales to read a pace
 * from. So a store that sells ten a day hears after two quiet days, one that
 * sells six a week after six, and one that sells twice a month never — its
 * quiet weeks are its usual ones. Once per quiet stretch: the claim is on the
 * last sale before it.
 *
 * Who. Only a store with a plan running and Stripe connected, and never one
 * whose creator stopped the numbers emails (the weekly one stops all three).
 * Read once a day per store by an hourly job (app/api/cron/quiet).
