/**
 * Deleting one person from a store (added 17 October 2026): the shape every
 * module's own eraser is given, and the limits the whole erasure keeps.
 *
 * A creator presses "Delete this person" on a buyer's page in the studio, or
 * the person proves their address by an emailed link and asks for it
 * themselves (lib/erasure-request.ts). Either way lib/person-erasure.ts asks
 * every module that keeps something about a person of a store to forget it,
 * through one function each module exports itself, and the registry in
 * lib/person-data.ts says, for every module that keeps anything keyed by or
 * naming a person, what it keeps and what becomes of it. A module that
 * begins to keep something per person and is not in that registry fails
 * tests/person-data-registry.test.ts.
 *
 * Nothing in this file touches the network, so a page may import it.
