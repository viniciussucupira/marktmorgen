/**
 * The series of calls a store has running (637 [GL5]; C2-94, added 4
 * November 2026): one sorted set per store's call diary (its callsId), each
 * member a series' id, scored by the end of its last session.
 *
 * Read by the currency route, which refuses to change the store's currency
 * while one runs (app/api/store/currency/route.ts): each series is charged
 * in the currency it was booked in (lib/call-series-billing.ts,
 * ChargeRecord.currency), and the store's pages would otherwise state its
 * sessions in another one. Written by the unit that books a series
 * (markSeriesOpen, again with the new end when its last session moves) and
 * the one that ends it early (markSeriesEnded), both through
 * lib/order-data.ts, so the store's data room is charged what each member
 * adds. A series whose last session has ended is not counted, and is
 * removed at the store's next write here, its bytes given back to the room
 * (seriesReleaseBytes); until then it stays with the store, one member per
 * series booked (tests/store-data-registry.ts).
 *
 * A series booked while the currency is being changed keeps the currency
 * it read at booking, whichever wins: its own records carry it, so nothing
 * is charged in another currency even then.
