/**
 * The store address typed on the home page, carried to the address step
 * (VS1, WCAG 3.3.7 Redundant Entry), so a creator never types it twice.
 *
 * It travels only in addresses: the home form's GET to /signin, the request
 * for the login link, the link in that email, the one-tap confirm page and
 * the redirect to the studio. Nothing here stores it, in the browser or on
 * the server, and nothing reserves it: the address is taken only by the
 * address step's own form (components/handle-form.tsx) through
 * app/api/store/claim, under the same rules as any other address, and
 * somebody may have taken it in the meantime.
 *
 * At every step it is read again from untrusted input with the store's own
 * handle rules; anything that is not a valid store address is dropped, and
 * the step simply opens empty, as it always did.
