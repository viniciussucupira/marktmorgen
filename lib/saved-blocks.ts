/**
 * Saved sections (added 17 October 2026): a group of a page's blocks kept in
 * the store's library under a name, to put on any other page of the store,
 * and changed once for every page that uses it when the creator chooses.
 *
 * ClickFunnels lists "universal" blocks beside its custom code. Here a
 * section is the same plain-text blocks a page is made of (lib/sales-page.ts)
 * and nothing else, so it can never carry a script. What a section never
 * holds:
 *
 *   - A hero or the reviews: a page has one of each, at their own places.
 *   - A picture. A picture belongs to the one page that shows it and is
 *     deleted with it (lib/sales-page-store.ts), so a section keeps the block
 *     and the creator adds that page's pictures to it.
 *
 * Each block put on a page from a section carries the section's id
 * (PageBlock.saved). A change to the section is offered to the pages that
 * carry it, listed first, and written only to those the creator checks; a
 * page with its own pictures in the section, or a test running, is listed
 * but left for the creator to change by hand. Pure and browser-safe.
