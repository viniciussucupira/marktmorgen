/**
 * Every run of a workflow, and what happened at each of its steps (added 17
 * October 2026).
 *
 * A run is one person going through one workflow: it starts when they are
 * started on it (lib/flows.ts, startFlows) and keeps, for 400 days, each step
 * it reached and what came of it:
 *
 *   attempted   written down BEFORE the email is handed to the sender or the
 *               action is carried out
 *   confirmed   the sender took the email, or the action's write was
 *               acknowledged
 *   failed      it is known not to have happened (the sender refused it, the
 *               deals board is full, no teammate may own the deal)
 *   uncertain   it may or may not have happened: the answer was lost, or a
 *               run stopped between the attempt and its outcome
 *   skipped     its condition did not hold; where the run went instead
 *
 * Nothing uncertain is ever tried again by itself. The attempt is claimed with
 * HSETNX on the run before the effect, and cleared only once an outcome is
 * known; a run that finds its own attempt still open (a timeout, a lost
 * reply, a job cut off) is held instead of repeating the step, and the studio
 * shows it with three choices for the creator: it went through, continue;
 * try it again, knowing it may arrive twice; or end the run.
 *
 *   nl:wf:run:<flowId>:<person>   hash: email, status, step, note, startedAt, updatedAt, open
 *   nl:wf:log:<flowId>:<person>   list of JSON events, oldest first, at most MAX_RUN_EVENTS
 *   nl:wf:runs:<flowId>           zset: person → last change, every run of the last 400 days
 *                                 (complete, so a person or a store can be erased in full)
 *   nl:wf:held:<listId>           zset: "<flowId>|<person>" → when it was held
 *   nl:wf:day:<listId>:<date>     hash: started, refused (UTC day), three days
 *
 * <person> is the same hash of the address the start itself is kept under,
 * never the address; the address is a field of the run, as it is a row of
 * the creator's own list.
 *
 * How much a run keeps is bounded by construction, never by trimming what
 * the job writes (18 October 2026). A run visits each step at most once
 * (routes only go forward, lib/flow-paths.ts) and each visit writes at most
 * an attempt and its outcome, or one skip; it starts once and ends once. So
 * without the creator a run writes at most 2 + 2 × MAX_STEPS events. Two
 * things could add more, and both are closed:
 *
 *   - A step that has to wait (the month's emails ran out, no room to send,
 *     the deals board could not be read) is tried again later. Its attempt is
 *     taken back out of the history when it turns out to be a wait
 *     (settleAttempts, "deferred"), so a wait of a month writes nothing.
 *   - The creator's choice for a held run ("continue" or "try it again")
 *     opens the step again. Each choice keeps only the run's latest
 *     KEPT_AFTER_CHOICE events, so what may follow it (2 + 2 × MAX_STEPS)
 *     still fits in MAX_RUN_EVENTS, the most the store's data room was
 *     charged for (lib/flows.ts, runBytes). The studio says when a run's
 *     earliest events were let go (lib/run-effects.ts, trimmed).
 *
 * A workflow's runs are bounded too: one person starts a workflow at most
 * once while the start is remembered (400 days, lib/flows.ts), and a store
 * starts at most its plan's runs a day across all its workflows
 * (lib/flow-limits.ts), so a workflow keeps at most MAX_RUNS_KEPT_PER_FLOW
 * runs, each charged to the store's data room before it starts.
