/**
 * When Stripe will not open a checkout (added 11 October 2026).
 *
 * A buyer presses buy, Stripe refuses to make the payment page — the account
 * needs something before it can take payments, a currency it cannot charge,
 * a price the creator archived in their own dashboard — and the buyer lands
 * back on the store with a sentence saying something went wrong. From the
 * creator's side nothing happened at all: no sale, no email, nothing in the
 * numbers. Crazy Egg sells error tracking, and Contentsquare and Mouseflow
 * sell friction monitoring, for this reason; here it is the one error that
 * costs a sale.
 *
 * Counted by the day, for 35 days, with the last refusal kept as Stripe
 * worded it. The creator is emailed the first time Stripe refuses on a day,
 * and at most once a day: only for a refusal Stripe made on purpose (an
 * answer from 400 to 499 other than "too many requests"), not for Stripe
 * being slow or down, which is Stripe's to fix and passes by itself. It goes
 * whether or not the numbers emails are stopped, because it is about the
 * store not taking money, not about its numbers. Nothing about the buyer is
 * kept.
 *
 *   nl:cotrouble:<statsId>              hash: <day> → refusals; "last" → JSON { at, code, message }
 *   nl:cotrouble:mail:<statsId>:<day>   the day's email, claimed (2 days)
