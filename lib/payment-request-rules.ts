/**
 * Payment requests and invoices (HighLevel audit H26, H27; added 18 October
 * 2026): the rules, browser-safe.
 *
 * A creator asks one person they already deal with (a coaching client, a
 * brand, a student who paid half) to pay a custom amount: one or more lines
 * of what it is for, an optional due date, and an email with a link. The
 * buyer opens a page of the store's that says who is asking, for what and
 * how much, and pays on Stripe's page on the creator's own Stripe account,
 * through the same checkout every sale here goes through
 * (lib/payment-requests.ts): the plan's share of the sale, the month's
 * order figure, sales tax and Stripe's invoice where the creator switched
 * them on, refunds and disputes on the creator's Stripe as for any sale.
 *
 * What it is not, on purpose:
 *
 *   - no late fee, no interest and nothing added for paying by link: the
 *     buyer pays the lines they were shown (and sales tax where the creator
 *     collects it), and the page says so;
 *   - no countdown and no "last chance": a due date is said as a date, and
 *     the link simply stops working when the request expires;
 *   - no reminder after the request is paid, withdrawn or expired, at most
 *     MAX_SENDS emails in all for one request, never two within a day, and
 *     each one taken from the store's own emails for the month
 *     (lib/store-allowance-rules.ts, "email") before it goes;
 *   - not marketing: it goes only to someone the creator says agreed to pay
 *     them for what it lists, and it adds nobody to any list.
 *
 * Every figure is enforced in code: open requests and requests kept per
 * store (REQUEST_LIMITS, by plan), requests kept per person
 * (MAX_PER_PERSON), the amount (a product's own price bounds,
 * lib/money.ts), the lines, the words and the days.
