/**
 * The buyer's yes before something is handed over during the 14-day
 * cancellation period, and what is kept of it (queue item 91
 * [D2-EU-WITHDRAWAL], 30 October 2026; corrected the same day after an
 * independent review).
 *
 * The law, read on 30 October 2026 from the adopted texts reproduced on
 * legislation.gov.uk (EUR-Lex's own article text could not be fetched from
 * here): Directive 2011/83/EU arts. 6(1)(k), 8(2), 8(7), 9(1), 9(2)(c) and
 * 14(3), as amended by Directive (EU) 2019/2161 art. 4(6), (7)(b), (11) and
 * (12), which replaced arts. 7(3), 8(8), 14(4)(b)(i), 16(a) and 16(m); and,
 * for the German words, § 356(6) no. 2 BGB (gesetze-im-internet.de). Two
 * rules apply, and the box says the one that fits:
 *
 *   - "digital" — digital content not on a tangible medium, sold once
 *     (a file, a link, a course, a private podcast, a bundle, a pre-order of
 *     one): the right to withdraw (14 days from the contract, art. 9(2)(c))
 *     is lost once supply has begun only if the consumer gave prior express
 *     consent to begin before the period ends, acknowledged that they
 *     thereby lose the right, and got the trader's confirmation on a durable
 *     medium (art. 16(m), art. 8(7)(b)). A pre-order begins on its release
 *     day, so its buyer keeps the right until then.
 *   - "membership" — a membership (a subscription that may hold a community,
 *     live events and coaching as well as content; the code cannot tell the
 *     service parts apart, so every membership is read this way): at least
 *     partly a service. The consumer asks expressly for it to start during
 *     the period (art. 8(8)); the right is lost only once the service is fully
 *     performed (art. 16(a)), and one who withdraws after asking pays in
 *     proportion to what was provided (art. 14(3)). So the box asks for the
 *     start and says what a cancellation in those 14 days costs, and never
 *     says the right is lost.
 *
 * The United Kingdom's rules are read the same way here; their own text was
 * not read on that date.
 *
 * Here the creator is the trader (app/terms, section 3); the store's checkout
 * asks on the creator's behalf, the same way for every buyer:
 *
 *   - one unchecked box before paying, on every form that pays for something
 *     handed over digitally (deliversDigitally), with the sentence of its
 *     kind (consentKind) in the store's language
 *     (lib/buyer-words/digital-consent.ts). Shown to every buyer, because the
 *     page cannot know who has the right; the note under it says it is for
 *     buyers who have that right where they live;
 *   - the server refuses to open the payment without it (consentFromForm,
 *     requireDigitalConsent): a forged form, a page from before the words
 *     changed (another version) or a missing box opens nothing;
 *   - each one-click offer after paying is its own contract, so it asks again
 *     on its own button (lib/upsell.ts);
 *   - what is kept is "yes", the version, the kind and the time, under
 *     CONSENT_META: on the order in the creator's own Stripe account, or, for
 *     a PayPal order, in Marktmorgen's own record of that order, which is
 *     kept 400 days (lib/paypal-sales.ts, PAID_KEPT_SECONDS). No other
 *     personal data, no cookie, no tracking;
 *   - the confirmation email (the durable medium) quotes the sentence, its
 *     version and the day, and says what follows for that order: access
 *     started, starts on the release day, or the membership's 14 days
 *     (lib/digital-consent-email.ts).
 *
 * A product shipped by the creator delivers nothing digital (lib/shipping.ts,
 * shipProblem refuses one with a file, link, course, podcast or bundle, on
 * the product or on any option), so it is never asked, whichever option is
 * picked. An order of one with a digital product added at checkout asks
 * about the added one only, and the email says the shipped item keeps its own
 * right. A booked call (a service, through its own door) and anything free
 * are not asked.
 *
 * Browser-safe: plain data and small functions, nothing from the server.
