/**
 * Numbers counted by the platform, for others to read (added 13 October
 * 2026): what the media kit can show a brand beside the follower counts the
 * creator types, and what a read-only link shows a partner
 * (lib/numbers-links.ts).
 *
 * Read before it was built: Plausible's, Fathom's, Simple Analytics' and
 * Pirsch's shared dashboards (a link, optionally with a password),
 * Baremetrics' Open Startups, DataFast's public dashboard and widgets, and
 * TrustMRR, which lists revenue read from the payment account rather than
 * typed. What they share is that the number comes from the system that
 * counted it, with the day it was read.
 *
 * Worked out once a day for the stores that use it (sendVerified, from the
 * daily job) and kept; the media kit and the link read only that record, so
 * opening them asks nothing of Stripe. Each record says the day it was read
 * and where each number comes from: visits counted on this store's pages,
 * payments on the creator's own Stripe account. Nobody is in it: no
 * address, no name, countries only as shares.
 *
 *   nl:verified:<statsId>   the record, three days
 *   nl:verified:cursor      where the last daily pass stopped
