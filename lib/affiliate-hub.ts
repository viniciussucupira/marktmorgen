/**
 * An affiliate's own page across every store (added 13 October 2026): one
 * place, at marktmorgen.com/affiliate, for somebody who promotes several
 * creators here.
 *
 * Each store already has its affiliates' page (app/[handle]/affiliates):
 * their link, their numbers, what the creator paid them. An affiliate of
 * five creators had five pages and five emails to sign in from. What keeps
 * an affiliate on a platform rather than with one seller is that their work
 * lives in one place: the programs they are in, side by side, and the
 * directory of programs they could join (app/affiliate-programs) one click
 * away. So this keeps, for an address, which stores it is an affiliate of,
 * and nothing else: the status, the link and the numbers are each store's
 * own, read from the store when the page is opened, and each store's page
 * is opened from here with a sign-in made for that address on the spot.
 *
 * What is kept is the least that can do it, the same as a buyer's library
 * (lib/buyer-library.ts): for an address, read only as a one-way hash of it,
 * the ids of the stores it joined. Written whenever a store writes the
 * affiliate down (lib/affiliates.ts, writeAffiliate) and whenever they sign
 * in to a store's page, so somebody who joined before this existed is found
 * the next time they open any one of them.
 *
 * Signing in is the library's: the address is typed, and a link that opens
 * the page for a day is emailed to it. Nothing is sent to an address that is
 * nobody's affiliate, and the answer on the page is the same either way, so
 * the form cannot be used to learn who promotes whom.
 *
 *   nl:affhub:<hash of the address>       the stores it is an affiliate of (a set of ids), kept 3 years after the last
 *   nl:affhub:link:<hash of a token>      the address a link was sent to, for a day
