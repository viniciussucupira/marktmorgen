/**
 * A student finishing a course (added 12 October 2026): the moment the last
 * lesson of it is marked done, by a button, a quiz passed or work approved.
 *
 * It is the best moment a course has to offer the next thing — Kajabi and
 * Teachable both start automations on it — and until now nothing happened
 * then. Now the sequences that start "when someone finishes" a course
 * (lib/flows.ts, trigger "finished") start for that student, if they agreed
 * to hear from the creator; nobody else is written to.
 *
 * A student finishes once: a flag kept for 400 days says it happened, so a
 * lesson marked undone and done again does not start anything twice.
