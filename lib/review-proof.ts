/**
 * Proof that a review comes from a buyer: the order behind it, as the
 * creator's own Stripe account tells it, every time a review is written,
 * changed or deleted — and the refunds that take a review's stars back.
 *
 * Nothing about purchases is written down by Marktmorgen (lib/buyer-orders.ts),
 * so a review is never checked against a list of ours. The buyer comes
 * through one of three doors, each holding something only a buyer has, and
 * the order that door names is then read from Stripe:
 *
 *   - the thanks page, by its checkout id, for the three days its download
 *     works (the same window, lib/store-checkout.ts);
 *   - the list of purchases, by the emailed link that opened it (24 hours)
 *     and one of the orders on it (lib/buyer-orders.ts);
 *   - the link in the one email that asks for a review (60 days), which
 *     names one order and the address it went to.
 *
 * An order counts when it is this store's, paid (not merely free after a
 * discount, and not a trial that has charged nothing yet), and not refunded
 * in full — the rule every other door uses (lib/refunds.ts). A checkout
 * counts for the product bought and the product ticked at checkout; an offer
 * taken in one click after paying counts for what it added. Booked calls are
 * not reviewed here.
 *
 * A refund that comes later is found by the five-minute job, which reads the
 * refunds on the creator's account for stores that have reviews and marks
 * each review that payment paid for (lib/reviews.ts, markRefunded).
 *
 *   nl:rev:link:<hash>             -> the order and address a review link is for, 60 days
 *   nl:rev:refunds:since:<statsId> -> how far the refund pass has read
 *   nl:rev:refunds:seen:<statsId>  -> refunds already handled
