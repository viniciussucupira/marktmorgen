/**
 * Moving from another platform: three imports, each a spreadsheet the
 * creator brings from Stan, Gumroad, Kajabi, Mailchimp or anywhere else.
 *
 *   contacts   addresses onto the store's email list — only people the
 *              creator confirms agreed to hear from them, and never anyone
 *              who unsubscribed here (lib/contacts.ts). Up to 50,000 rows.
 *   products   drafts in the store, each checked the way the product editor
 *              checks it, hidden until the creator publishes it. Up to 500.
 *   members    members of a membership elsewhere, each emailed their own link
 *              to keep it here, first charged on the day it would have
 *              renewed there (lib/move-members.ts). Nobody is given a
 *              membership: keeping it is a checkout. Up to 20,000 rows, and
 *              the emails count with the past buyers' in the same month.
 *   purchases  past buyers given what they bought before, with no payment
 *              and no receipt here, marked for what they are
 *              (lib/imported-purchases.ts). Up to 20,000 rows, and, only if
 *              the creator ticks it, one email to each buyer saying so — at
 *              most what reserveMoved allows a store in a calendar month, and
 *              within the company's daily cap (lib/mail.ts), since they go
 *              out from our sender to addresses only the creator vouches for.
 *
 * The browser reads the file (lib/csv.ts), the creator says which column is
 * which, and the rows come here in batches of up to BATCH_ROWS, each cell
 * capped. Nothing is trusted: every row is checked again here, when it is
 * applied. The work itself is done a chunk at a time — a few hundred rows,
 * or fifty products — so no request runs long: the studio's page advances it
 * while it is open (runImport, from app/api/store/import), and the job every
 * five minutes finishes whatever is left (app/api/cron/imports). Two never
 * run the same import at once: each takes the import's lock.
 *
 * Every row that is not brought in is written down with its row number, the
 * column and the reason, and the creator downloads that as a spreadsheet
 * (lib/csv.ts writes it, so nothing in it runs as a formula). A store runs
 * one import at a time.
 *
 *   nl:import:<id>              the import: its kind, store, state, counts
 *   nl:import:<id>:rows         the rows as they came, one batch per entry
 *   nl:import:<id>:seen         what was seen already -> the row it was on
 *   nl:import:<id>:errors       rows not brought in, for the report
 *   nl:import:<id>:mail         buyers still to be emailed (purchases only)
 *   nl:import:<id>:lock         whoever is working on it now
 *   nl:imports:busy:<sid>       the import a store is running, while it runs
 *   nl:imports:list:<sid>       the store's last imports, newest first
 *   nl:imports:active           imports with work left, for the job
 *
 * Everything but the list of a store's last imports is let go two weeks
 * after the import began.
 *
 * Moving from ClickFunnels (added 17 October 2026) is the same three imports
 * of contacts, products and past buyers, read the way ClickFunnels' exports
 * are written (lib/clickfunnels-csv.ts), with two differences: a contact
 * without recorded consent comes in as a contact the creator cannot email
 * rather than being left out, and an opt-out there is kept here. Before any
 * import, previewImport is its dry run: every row checked here the way the
 * import will check it, against the store as it is, and nothing written.
