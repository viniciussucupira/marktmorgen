/**
 * A member switching their membership to another tier, up or down, on the
 * creator's own Stripe account (the rules are in lib/tier-rules.ts).
 *
 *   nl:tier:price:<account>:<product>:<amount>:<currency>:<interval>   the price made for a tier, reused
 *
 * From the member's own page (lib/membership-manage.ts), reached by the link
 * emailed to the address they pay with. Two steps, so nothing is charged by
 * surprise:
 *
 *   1. The page for one switch asks Stripe what it would cost right now —
 *      Stripe's own preview of the invoice, prorated to the second — and
 *      says it: "$12.40 today", or "$8.10 comes off your next payments".
 *   2. The button makes that switch at the same second the preview used, so
 *      the amount charged is the amount shown. The card on file is charged at
 *      once; if it is declined nothing changes and the invoice is voided.
 *
 * The switch replaces the subscription's price with one made for the new
 * tier, which names its product in its own metadata. Every door reads the
 * tier from there (lib/tier-rules.ts, currentMeta), so what the member pays
 * and what they get change together. In a free trial nothing is charged now
 * and the new price starts when the trial ends. A member keeps whatever
 * discount their membership already had.
 *
 * A member who paid and was given free days (lib/member-free-days.ts) reads
 * "trialing" on Stripe, which prorates nothing in a trial: a switch then would
 * hand the new tier over for nothing until the free days end. So it is refused
 * while they run ("freeDays"), and the page says why; it opens again with the
 * next charge (Claude 4 team review of #2912, A1).
