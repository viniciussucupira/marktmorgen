/**
 * Two emails during the free trial, to a store that has not sold yet, each
 * with the one thing that would most help it sell (added 11 October 2026).
 *
 * Why. A trial answers "is this worth paying for?" only if something sells
 * inside it (lib/plan.ts, TRIAL_DAYS). The studio already walks a creator to
 * the first sale (components/studio-start.tsx, then lib/store-coach.ts), but
 * only a creator who opens the studio sees it, and the ones who do not are
 * the ones who reach the first charge with nothing sold and cancel. Stan,
 * which writes to no such creator, loses about 13% of its creators a month
 * (Contrary, August 2026).
 *
 * What it is, precisely:
 *
 *   - On NUDGE_DAYS of the trial, counted from its first day: one email each,
 *     never twice for the same subscription, and none once the store has sold
 *     (lib/yearly-offer.ts, firstSaleAt) or the trial is set to stop.
 *   - Each names one step, the first that is missing, in the order a store
 *     can sell: something to sell, the creator's Stripe account, then the
 *     store coach's weightiest missing check, and last the address shared.
 *   - Two, and said to be two. A trial that writes every day is a trial that
 *     gets unsubscribed from, and the pre-charge notice (lib/billing-reminders)
 *     is a third email the trial already has.
