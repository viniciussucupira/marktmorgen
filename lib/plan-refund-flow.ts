/**
 * A plan refund from start to finish (305 [SY1] unit 2b1): the plan is set
 * to stop, the money is given back (lib/plan-refund-write.ts), and the plan
 * is ended at once, as app/refunds/page.tsx says ("A refund closes the paid
 * features of the store it was for … from the day it is made"). The route,
 * the button, its review page and the confirmation email are unit 2b2;
 * nothing but the daily job calls this yet.
 *
 * The order is the safe one:
 *   1. a note is written first (ENDING_KEY, field the store's id): "a refund
 *      was asked at `at` for subscription `s`", so whatever stops this
 *      request half way, the daily job (finishPlanRefunds, from
 *      app/api/cron/closing) finds it and finishes;
 *   2. the subscription is set to stop at the end of its period, so no
 *      renewal can be charged while the refund is made;
 *   3. the refund, once (lib/plan-refund-write.ts);
 *   4. made: the subscription is ended now (DELETE, no proration, no final
 *      invoice), its open invoices voided and its drafts deleted (Stripe
 *      "stops automatic collection" of them on a cancel but they could still
 *      be paid by hand), the store written down as having no plan (which
 *      starts the closing rules of lib/plan-closing-rules.ts), a break taken
 *      back and the add-on set to stop at the end of its paid month as its
 *      policy says (lib/assistant-billing.ts); then the note is removed;
 *   5. refused (nothing was sent to Stripe): the stop set in step 2 is
 *      taken back at once, so a refused refund never costs the creator their
 *      plan. A stop the creator had set themselves before is left as it was;
 *   6. maybe made (the write failed or timed out, the refunds could not be
 *      read, or an earlier request left a note): the note AND the stop stay,
 *      so no renewal can be charged before it is decided; the daily job ends
 *      the plan if the refund turns up, and takes the stop back only once it
 *      concludes none was made (SETTLE_SECONDS after the last try).
 * The plan is ended only on a refund Stripe says succeeded: a pending one
 * (it may still fail and give the money back to the charge) keeps the note
 * and the stop for the daily job. A refund whose answer was lost is found by
 * its metadata (`plan_refund` = the store's id) among the platform's refunds
 * made between the note and SETTLE_SECONDS after its last try. Undecidable
 * for GIVE_UP_DAYS: the stop is taken back and the plan goes on as it was,
 * never ended without a refund that can be seen.
 *
 * One at a time per store (FLOW_LOCK_SECONDS, lib/redis-lock.ts); the daily
 * job skips a store whose lock is held.
