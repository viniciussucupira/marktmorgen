/**
 * The daily job that keeps every share taken to what is owed
 * (lib/platform-share.ts says what is owed, and why).
 *
 * Three steps, each bounded by the run's deadline and each safe to repeat,
 * because it reads what Stripe holds now and acts only on the difference:
 *
 *   1. Fees taken in the last few days. A fee set on a checkout is the share
 *      of the least the buyer could pay; this gives back the part above the
 *      share of what they did pay, once the discount and the tax are known.
 *   2. Payments refunded or lost to a dispute since the last run, on the
 *      accounts of stores that pay a share: the share of what was given back
 *      is given back too. A creator who refunds a buyer from their own Stripe
 *      dashboard does not get the fee back from Stripe by itself.
 *   3. The percentage written on each membership a store sold, kept to the
 *      store's plan: when a creator moves to a plan with a smaller share, or
 *      none, or their plan ends, the memberships they sold stop paying the
 *      old one; when they move to one with a larger share, they pay it from
 *      their next payment.
 *
 * It only ever gives back. A fee is never raised after a payment, so a
 * mistake here can only cost us, never a creator.
