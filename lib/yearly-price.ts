/**
 * Paying yearly for a monthly membership (added 10 October 2026): the buyer
 * picks "Monthly, $20 a month" or "Yearly, $200 a year, save $40" in the buy
 * box, and the subscription is made at that price and schedule on the
 * creator's own Stripe account. The rules, which the browser can read too.
 *
 * Patreon, Skool and Kajabi offer a yearly price beside the monthly one;
 * creators sell it to keep members for a year at a time. What keeps it
 * honest and simple:
 *
 *   - The saving said is exactly twelve monthly payments less the yearly
 *     price, and a yearly price is only kept below that, so it always saves.
 *   - One membership, one product: whoever pays yearly gets what monthly
 *     members get, and the thank-you page and the confirmation say "a year".
 *   - Only on a monthly membership that runs until canceled, at one price,
 *     outside the plans members switch between, and not beside an
 *     introductory price (one offer at a time; a free trial is fine, before
 *     either). A product changed after it was set stops offering it.
