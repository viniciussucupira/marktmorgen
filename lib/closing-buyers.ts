/**
 * The buyers of a store that closes, told by Marktmorgen itself (queue item
 * 307 [EC1], part 5; lib/closing-buyers-rules.ts says why and what).
 *
 *   tellBuyers     BUYER_NOTICE_DAYS days before the closing at the least:
 *                  one service email to everyone who bought from the store
 *                  (its members held, the payments that name it in their
 *                  metadata on the creator's Stripe account, its PayPal
 *                  sales, and the buyers it brought over or was given as
 *                  gifts), each address once, a part a day, up to a cap on
 *                  what is read
 *   tellStaysOpen  the plan was started again after that: one short email to
 *                  each address that was told
 *   tellRefundShort  a member whose refund the store's balance did not cover
 *
 * The cap, before every email: the closing's emails, set when its members
 * were held (lib/closing-credit.ts, buyerNoticeCap), a post-cancellation
 * funded exposure of docs/funded-exposure-review.md. Telling a buyer takes EMAILS_PER_BUYER_PER_ENDING from it at
 * once, the notice and the one follow-up either of the two others can be,
 * so a follow-up is never short of what it costs. An address the cap no
 * longer covers is not written to, and is counted (`untold`) for the
 * creator's notices and studio, never left silent.
 *
 *   nl:closing:credit:<folder>  what is left of the closing's emails (lib/closing-credit.ts)
 *   nl:closing:told:<folder>    the addresses told for this ending, until the store closes or stays
 *
 * Sent from Marktmorgen's own address with its postal address
 * (lib/company-postal.ts), counted on the company's sender (EmailMeter
 * "company"), never on the store's own emails, which end with its plan.
