/**
 * The read-only tools of the MCP server beyond the first three (added 12
 * October 2026): revenue by channel, the funnel, each product, memberships,
 * emails, affiliates, buyers in numbers and what is worth knowing — each the
 * same numbers the studio shows, read by the same functions and their caches
 * (app/api/mcp/route.ts).
 *
 * Read before it was built: DataFast's 67 MCP tools, Umami's 23 read-only
 * ones (run_funnel, run_attribution, get_revenue), ChartMogul's, Matomo's,
 * Northbeam's and Polar's. What they share is that the assistant gets the
 * numbers the product already shows, each tool narrow enough to answer one
 * kind of question.
 *
 * Nobody is named. No tool here returns a buyer's, member's, subscriber's or
 * affiliate's address, name or words: an assistant's conversation is kept by
 * whoever runs the assistant, and those people never agreed to be read there.
 * Affiliates are their link's code; members' reasons for leaving are counted,
 * not quoted. Money is in the smallest unit of the store's currency.
