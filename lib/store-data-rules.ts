/**
 * What a store may keep in the database, the rules (added 18 October 2026).
 *
 * Every record a store keeps in Redis is paid for every month it is kept, at
 * Upstash's storage rate, and many of them grow with a store's age: its
 * products and pages, its contacts, its community's posts, the records each
 * of its orders leaves. Until this day only some kinds had a count of their
 * own, so no plan's worst month could say what a store's records cost
 * (tests/plan-cost-registry.ts, the line database-storage).
 *
 * So each store has a data room: a number of bytes, by plan, that what it
 * keeps there may fill, measured where it is written (lib/store-data.ts) and
 * given back where it goes. Two kinds of writes take from it:
 *
 *   - What a store chooses to keep: the store's own record and its
 *     products, pages, posts, notes, contacts, forms and what buyers write
 *     inside what they bought. Taken before it is written, all or nothing:
 *     what does not fit is refused with a sentence saying so, and nothing is
 *     written. Deleting, shortening and hiding are never refused.
 *   - What an order leaves: ORDER_DATA_BYTES for each order counted
 *     (lib/orders.ts), whatever it is, and never refused, because a buyer
 *     who paid must get everything. Its room is held up front instead: a new
 *     checkout is admitted only while the room has space for it and for
 *     every checkout still open (lib/order-admission.ts), the way the
 *     month's order figure is, and what a store chooses to keep may fill the
 *     room only up to ORDER_RESERVE_WINDOWS windows of orders from the top,
 *     so a full room never stops sales on its own.
 *
 * Records that are not in the room are bounded another way, each in
 * tests/store-data-registry.ts: they expire within days of the use that
 * wrote them, or are capped in number and size, or belong to the company
 * and not to a store. That file fails when a key family is added without
 * saying which.
 *
 * Pure and browser-safe: the studio shows the same figures the writes are
 * refused at.
