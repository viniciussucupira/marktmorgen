/**
 * A backup in parts (273 [BK1]; inbox C4-30): the database copied as a set of
 * sealed parts of at most PART_MAX_BYTES each, plus a sealed manifest that
 * names every part with its rows, its size and the SHA-256 of what was
 * stored. One store at full use can keep far more than one sealed object
 * holds (docs/backup-cost-2026-11-04.md), so a single object refused them all.
 *
 * - Every part is sealed (lib/backup-codec.ts), written create-only and read
 *   back before the next one is copied; the manifest is written last and read
 *   back too. The set counts as verified only when the manifest read back
 *   names every part with the sums of what was stored.
 * - Nothing here is ever deleted or replaced: a run that fails leaves the parts
 *   it wrote as unreferenced objects (no manifest names them) and every earlier
 *   verified set as it was. The run deletes every object past the retention
 *   before its next copy (lib/backup-run.ts); the bucket's lifecycle rule is a
 *   safety net.
 * - The walk reads at most BACKUP_SCAN_PAGES pages; a walk not done by then
 *   is refused ("scan_pages") before anything is written.
 * - Inside a cutoff (lib/fetch-timeout.ts, withCutoff; the run's is
 *   BACKUP_RUN_CUTOFF_MS), no page, batch, part or manifest is begun after it
 *   ("cutoff"); outside one there is none.
 * - The walk's and the copy's commands are counted against the run's cap
 *   before the first DUMP; the parts and the bytes are counted as the copy
 *   goes, each row at the bytes it adds to its part's JSON: a database larger
 *   than the run may copy is refused, never written as a whole set.
 *
 * Server-only. Built and off: nothing schedules it (lib/backup-run.ts).
