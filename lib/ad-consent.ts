/**
 * The buyer's yes to ad measurement, as the server can read it (added 12
 * October 2026), and the ad clicks that brought them.
 *
 * The yes itself is given where it always was: the store's own question, or
 * no question where the law asks none and the browser does not send Global
 * Privacy Control (components/store-pixels.tsx). Until now it lived only in
 * the browser, so only the browser could say "send this purchase", and a buyer
 * who closed the tab on Stripe's page was never sent. Now the same yes is also
 * written in a cookie of this store's, which every checkout route reads
 * (lib/ad-events.ts adsCheckout): the checkout then carries it, and the
 * purchase is sent from the server when Stripe says it is paid, whether or
 * not the buyer comes back. A no, or Global Privacy Control, deletes the
 * cookie; with no cookie nothing is ever sent from here.
 *
 * With the yes, the cookie keeps the click id the visitor last arrived with
 * from an ad — Meta's fbclid, TikTok's ttclid, Pinterest's epik — for thirty
 * days, so a sale a few visits later can still be matched to the ad. Not
 * Google's gclid: Google takes conversions from the server through Google
 * Analytics, which ties them to the click itself, and keeping it here would
 * be keeping something never sent. Nothing else, and nobody's name or address.
 *
 * Pure, so the browser that writes it and the server that reads it share one
 * reading.
