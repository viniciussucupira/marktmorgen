/**
 * What the buyers of a product also bought (added 10 October 2026), counted
 * from the store's own paid sales and nothing else.
 *
 * Amazon's "frequently bought together" is one of the oldest ways a shop sells
 * more; Gumroad, Stan, Kajabi and Hotmart product pages have nothing like it.
 * Here it is measured, not guessed, and said only as what was measured:
 *
 *   - Read with the store's all-time sales (lib/stats.ts, readAllTimeSales),
 *     from the creator's own Stripe account: the product of each paid
 *     checkout, the ones added to it, and the ones taken in one click after.
 *   - Grouped by buyer, by the address they paid with, so "also bought" means
 *     the same person bought both, in one checkout or in two. Each buyer
 *     counts once for each pair, however often they bought.
 *   - Said only from MIN_TOGETHER buyers up, so nobody's own purchase can be
 *     read off a page, and as "N buyers bought both" — exactly the count.
 *   - Shown only by a store whose creator chose to show what was bought
 *     (StoreLook.sold), kept with those counts (lib/sold-count.ts).
