/**
 * How far down a product's sales page visitors read: for each block, the

 *
 * Measured before it was built (7 October 2026): Kajabi, Stan, Hotmart,
 * Gumroad and Whop report views and sales of a page, not where on it people
 * stop. A creator who sees that half the visitors never get past the third
 * block knows which block to rewrite, or which to move up.
 *
 * What is kept, and what is not: when a visitor leaves the page, it sends the
 * id of the furthest block they saw (components/page-depth.tsx) — one visitor
 * in eight, since 11 October 2026 (lib/page-read.ts). One hash per product
 * counts, for each block id, how many visitors stopped there. No cookie, no address, nothing about who.
 * A block's share is everybody who stopped at it or further down, worked out
 * from the page as it is now; a removed block's count is simply not shown.
 *
 *   nl:depth:<statsId>:<productId>   hash: <blockId> (stopped there); _n (visitors) until 11 October 2026
