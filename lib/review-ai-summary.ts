/**
 * The AI summary of a product's reviews, 636 [GL4](d), unit 2: made and kept
 * (the rules are lib/review-ai-summary-rules.ts). One of the month's AI jobs
 * (lib/ai.ts, counted), on the smaller model, made only when the creator
 * asks, at most once a week for a product, and only from enough reviews.
 * Kept eight days, only the themes and their counts: a review it counted
 * that is deleted, hidden, refunded or rewritten takes it away in the same
 * request as that change (lib/reviews.ts, summaryGone), so when it cannot be
 * taken away the change fails too; a review written after it was made never
 * takes it away. Reading it is one small request. Nothing is drawn yet for
 * buyers: the product page is reserved by other open work.

 *   nl:rsum:<statsId>:<productId>:themes  sorted set: the summary's themes under

 *                                       that goes or changes removes it in one
 *                                       command (ZREMRANGEBYSCORE), so the head
 *                                       alone is never read as a summary
