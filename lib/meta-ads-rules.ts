 *
 *   - the channel is the platform as the numbers count it: Instagram is
 *     "instagram", Threads "threads", and Facebook, Messenger and the
 *     Audience Network "facebook";
 *   - the campaign is the campaign's name as a utm_campaign is counted
 *     (lib/source-rules.ts, cleanTag), so a link tagged
 *     utm_campaign={{campaign.name}} in Ads Manager lands on the same row;
 *   - the amount is in the ad account's currency, in its smallest unit, and
 *     is read only when that is the store's currency: no rate is guessed.
