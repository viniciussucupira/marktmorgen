/**
 * A creator disputing a payment they made to us for their plan (queue item
 * 232 [CA1] unit 5). Pure: no store, no Stripe.
 *
 * Stripe leaves the subscription active and the invoice paid when a payment
 * is disputed, so nothing in the subscription says it. The daily job reads
 * the disputes on our own account (lib/plan-disputes.ts), finds the plan
 * invoice each one is about, and writes it on the store's record. From then:
 *
 *   - while the bank has not decided ("open"), what costs us to run stops,
 *     exactly as for an unpaid renewal (lib/plan-standing.ts, costsPaused);
 *   - decided for us ("won", or an inquiry closed without a chargeback):
 *     everything starts again;
 *   - decided for the creator ("lost" for us): the money went back, so the
 *     period that payment covered is unpaid and stays paused to its end.
 *     When the end could not be read, a year from the dispute, the longest
 *     period any plan has (unknown is never read as "no time").
 *
 * Nothing closes and nothing is deleted: the store's page, the studio,
 * exports and deletion stay open, as for an unpaid renewal.
