/**
 * Captions written by AI for a lesson's video (lib/auto-captions-rules.ts
 * says what they cost, and why that way).
 *
 * Pressed in the studio: the price is charged on the card the plan is paid
 * with, then the video service is asked to write them. It answers on its own
 * time, a few minutes for most lessons; it is asked again until every
 * language asked for is there (and told by its announcement too,
 * app/api/stream/hook), and each language is listed for the lesson as it
 * arrives. What has not arrived after GIVE_UP_HOURS is refunded.
 *
 *   nl:stream:auto:<video>   what is being written, and the charge for it
 *   nl:stream:autoq          which videos to ask about, and when
 *
 * A refund Stripe has not confirmed as succeeded is never taken as done: the
 * record is kept with what is owed (`owed`), the video is asked about again,
 * and each look first reads the payment's refunds from Stripe. A new refund
 * is asked for only when Stripe lists none still in flight and not enough
 * returned, under a key that follows what Stripe listed, so two looks at
 * once ask for the same one and money is never returned twice.
