/**
 * A short-window limit and a store's monthly figure, checked together
 * (added 17 October 2026). The short limit (lib/request-guard.ts,
 * withinLimit) keeps one connection or one loop from a burst; the figure is
 * what bounds the store's month, the one each plan's worst month prices
 * (tests/plan-cost-registry.ts):
 *
 *   withinStore    a public request a store answers: its cart, a search, a
 *                  download, the page after paying... counted with the pages
 *                  it draws (lib/traffic.ts, takePublicRequest).
 *   withinService  a call to another service made for a store: counted as
 *                  one of its "integration" figure (lib/store-allowance-rules.ts).
 *
 * The registry finds every scope used with either, so a public path or a
 * call out cannot be added without a figure.
