/**
 * What a page opened by the checkout script (lib/embed-sdk.ts) may do, worked
 * out on the server for each open: the product's card at /embed/<store>/<product>
 * and the sign-up form at /embed/<store>/join, with ?mm=overlay or ?mm=page.
 *
 * An open is a person who pressed a link, never a page view, and it is paid
 * for like a visit to the store's own pages:
 *
 *   - counted toward the visits the store's plan covers (lib/traffic.ts), once
 *     a person a day, never a robot's or the store's own people's;
 *   - refused its buy button and form when the store is past them
 *     (isResting), as its other pages rest, and when one connection has
 *     opened more than OPENS_PER_TEN_MINUTES in ten minutes: the frame then
 *     shows the plain link to the product's page;
 *   - in a frame, given its buttons and its messages only on a site the
 *     creator listed (lib/embed-sites.ts), read from the Referer.
