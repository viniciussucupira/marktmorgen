/**
 * Booking a team event type (lib/team-scheduling-rules.ts): who is free,
 * who gets the booking, and taking their time.
 *
 * A team is kept beside the call it belongs to, one hash per store:
 *
 *   nl:callteam:<callsId>              product id -> TeamSetup, as JSON
 *   nl:callteam:rr:<callsId>:<product> host id -> bookings of it so far, for round robin
 *
 * It is only used while its product is a call with weekly hours and one seat
 * per time; a call changed to anything else is sold as it is, and its team
 * waits. Who may host is read every time: the store's owner and the people on
 * its team now (lib/team.ts), so somebody taken off the team stops being
 * offered at their very next booking. What the plan allows is read every time
 * too (teamLimitsFor): the oldest team event types, and the first hosts on
 * each, up to the plan's numbers; any beyond are closed for booking until the
 * plan allows them again.
 *
 * What a host is taken for comes from three places, all read for every
 * booking page and checked again under the store's lock before a time is
 * held: their claims on every store (lib/host-claims.ts), this store's paid
 * bookings that name them (Stripe is the ledger, so a buyer who paid and never
 * came back still counts) and, for the store's owner, every ordinary call of
 * the store, and their own calendar's busy times (lib/host-calendar.ts), which
 * block the host altogether when they cannot be read.
