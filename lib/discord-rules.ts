/**
 * Discord access (added 11 October 2026): a creator's own Discord server,
 * opened by what buyers pay for on their store. Plain rules, browser-safe;
 * the calls to Discord are in lib/discord.ts, what is kept in
 * lib/discord-store.ts, and who is given what in lib/discord-access.ts.
 *
 * The creator adds Marktmorgen's bot to their server once, and picks for any
 * product up to MAX_PRODUCT_ROLES of the server's roles. A buyer presses
 * "Join the Discord", says yes on Discord's own page, and is put in the
 * server with those roles. While they hold the product — paid and not
 * refunded, a membership still running — they keep them; once they do not,
 * the roles are taken back at the next check, within CHECK_HOURS, and if the
 * creator asked for it, they are taken out of the server too.
 *
 * Nobody types a Discord name anywhere: who a buyer is on Discord is what
 * Discord says when they agree, and which products they hold is read from
 * the creator's own Stripe account, as every other door of the store reads
 * it (lib/community-access.ts).
