/**
 * Moving a ClickFunnels funnel (added 17 October 2026): the creator's saved
 * pages (lib/clickfunnels-page.ts), each given its place in the journey, made
 * into this platform's own pieces.
 *
 * ClickFunnels keeps a funnel's order, its checkouts and its offers in its own
 * account and exports none of it (docs/clickfunnels-import.md), so the creator
 * says, page by page, what each one was:
 *
 *   page       one of the store's own pages (lib/site-page-rules.ts), with the
 *              page's words in blocks, kept back from visitors until the
 *              creator lets it out; its form, when it had one, made under Forms
 *   checkout   ClickFunnels' order form: here, the product's own page and
 *              checkout take the step's place. The words of the page are not
 *              copied; each order bump it had becomes a box at that checkout
 *              (lib/product-extras.ts) for the product the creator picks
 *   upsell     an offer after paying for the checkout before it, one click
 *              (lib/funnel.ts), with the page's headline and first lines
 *   downsell   the offer shown to whoever says no to the upsell just before it
 *   skip       left out
 *
 * and the pages and checkouts become one funnel of pages (lib/page-funnel.ts),
 * in the order given, switched off until the creator switches it on.
 *
 * planFunnelImport is the dry run: everything checked against the store as it
 * stands, every piece to be made listed, every problem said, and nothing
 * written. saveFunnelImport makes it, after the same plan again under the
 * store's own lock for this, and only when the plan has no error.
 *
 * Doing it twice makes nothing twice. Each run is written down by what it was
 * asked (a key made from the pages and choices); asking the same again answers
 * with what the first made. A page already made by an earlier run, and still
 * there, is used again rather than made again, so a run that stopped partway
 * is finished by running it again. A box at checkout for a product already
 * offered there, and offers after paying on a product that already has them,
 * are left as they are and said so.
 *
 * Nothing here costs per use: no email is sent, no AI is asked, no file is
 * stored or fetched. What is made is bounded by the limits the store already
 * has: ten own pages, twenty forms, ten funnels, three boxes at checkout and
 * five offers after paying per product, a page's own weight.
