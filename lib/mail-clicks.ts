/**
 * Which links in a sequence's emails somebody used — only for somebody who
 * allowed it (added 11 October 2026).
 *
 * A sequence could send an email only to some of the people in it, read from
 * what the list keeps (lib/flow-rules.ts). The condition creators reach for
 * first — "if they used the link in the last email, send this; if not, that"
 * — needs to know who used a link, and the emails had promised to say
 * nothing about who anybody is (lib/mail-links.ts). Counting it for everyone
 * would break that promise, and in Europe it needs the reader's consent.
 *
 * So it is asked for, apart from joining: a second box, empty, under the box
 * that joins the list, which only shows once that one is ticked. Somebody who
 * ticks it gets, in a sequence's emails, links to the creator's store that
 * carry one more parameter: a key made from their unsubscribe token, which
 * cannot be turned back into it. When that link opens a page of the store,
 * the page (components/mail-click.tsx) says which email it came from, and
 * the key is taken out of the address bar. Nothing else is counted: no
 * pixel, no open, no link to anywhere but the store, no one-off email.
 *
 *   nl:mail:mk:<key>               the unsubscribe token it was made from
 *   nl:mail:clk:<list>:<person>    the emails whose links they used (a set),
 *                                  gone 90 days after the last one
 *
 * Taken back in one press from a line at the foot of every email they get
 * while it is on (app/unsubscribe, an `l` link), which deletes what was
 * counted at once; and by unsubscribing, which takes it back too.
 * Somebody who never allowed it, or took it back, counts as not having used
 * any link, so an email "for those who did not" still reaches them.
