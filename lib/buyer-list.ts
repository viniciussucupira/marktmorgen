 * A paid order on the creator's list (added 11 October 2026): the buyer
 * joined when they ticked the box, what they bought noted against them, and
 * the sequences that start on it started.
 *
 * This was done by the thanks page alone, so a buyer who closed the tab while
 * Stripe was sending them there was confirmed by the five-minute job
 * (lib/checkout-sweep.ts) and never put on the list: no welcome, no emails
 * after the purchase, and a sequence meant to stop once they bought went on
 * selling them what they already had. Now both call this, and whichever gets
 * there first does it, once per checkout.
