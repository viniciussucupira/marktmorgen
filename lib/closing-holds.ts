/**
 * The members of a store whose plan ended, on the creator's own Stripe
 * account (queue item 307 [EC1], parts 2 and 4; lib/closing-buyers-rules.ts
 * says why).
 *
 *   holdCharges     from the day the plan ended: every membership and payment
 *                   plan the store sold stops being charged (Stripe's pause of
 *                   collection, invoices voided, no day to resume); its open
 *                   invoices are voided and its drafts kept as drafts, so no
 *                   invoice from before is collected either; and each
 *                   member's last paid invoice is written down, for the time
 *                   they paid for past the closing day (lib/closing-refunds.ts).
 *                   Page by page from where the last run stopped; a member
 *                   that could not be held is written down and tried again
 *                   every day (retryHolds), and counted for the creator.
 *   releaseHolds    the plan was started again before the closing: each one
 *                   goes on exactly as it was, nothing charged for the days
 *                   between (voided invoices are never charged)
 *   releaseRestarted  the daily job's walk of the stores held, for the plans
 *                   started again since (the store record leaves the line of
 *                   ended plans the moment a plan runs, so the closing job
 *                   alone would never see it). A store whose closing day has
 *                   begun is not in it any more: from then on it closes.
 *
 * Read on 30 October 2026 in Stripe's documentation:
 * docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment ("the subscription
 * remains active and invoices continue to generate, but Stripe doesn't
 * collect payment"; void: "No record of charges is created for these
 * periods"; resume by unsetting pause_collection; "Invoices created before
 * you pause subscriptions continue to be retried unless you void them"; a
 * draft is not collected while its auto_advance is false);
 * docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void ("Mark a finalized invoice as void").
 *
 *   nl:closing:paid:<folder>   hash  subscription -> its last payment (PaidPeriod), from the hold to the closing
 *   nl:closing:work:<folder>   hash  where the hold and the release stopped, the members not held yet
 *                                    ("f:<sub>"), those past the call budget ("o:<sub>"), and what is
 *                                    left of the budget ("calls")
 *   nl:closing:held            sorted set  a store's key -> when its plan ended, while its members are held
 *   nl:closing:final           sorted set  a store's key -> when its plan ended, from its closing day's start to its end
 *
 * Every write to Stripe carries an idempotency key and every call is taken
 * from the closing's budget first (STRIPE_CALLS_PER_MEMBER for each member
 * the cap allows). Nothing here is silent: what was not done is logged and
 * counted for the creator's notices.
