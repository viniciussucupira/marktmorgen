/**
 * What a store kept, by currency (added 18 October 2026; ClickFunnels audit
 * F51 and F52, priority 4 "Reconciled retained revenue").
 *
 * For each window, every currency the store was paid in gets one line:
 *
 *   paid at checkout (purchases and one-click extras)
 * + renewals (memberships renewed, later plan payments)
 * − refunds given in the window
 * − disputed money the bank holds or the buyer won (DISPUTE_TAKES)
 * = kept.
 *
 * Currencies are never added together and nothing is converted: euros added
 * to dollars make a number that means nothing. A line is "complete" only when
 * every one of its four readings was read in full; otherwise its kept figure
 * is null and the page says which reading is missing, because a figure with
 * a reading left out looks exactly like a real one.
 *
 * Refunds and disputes count on the day they were recorded, which may be
 * after the sale they take back (as the money-by-source table already says).
 * The disputed amount is before Stripe's dispute fee, which Stripe charges
 * the creator separately and is not read here. PayPal disputes are not read
 * at all, and the page says so when the store sells through PayPal.
 *
 * For the store's own currency, the kept money is also split by the channel a
 * sale is under, so the money with no channel recorded is visible instead of
 * folded into a total: "direct" (a sale that carried no tag and no remembered
 * visit) and "unrecorded" (a renewal, refund or dispute that could not be
 * matched to a sale read). A channel says where the buyer came from; it does
 * not show that the channel caused the sale (ATTRIBUTION_NOTE).
 *
 * Pure: imports nothing, so the studio, the tests and the CSV read one rule.
 */

/**
 * The states of a Stripe dispute in which the money is not the creator's:
 * held by the bank while it is answered or reviewed, or taken back for good.
 * An inquiry (warning_*) takes nothing, and a dispute won gives it back.
 * The affiliate book (lib/affiliates.ts) reads the same set.
