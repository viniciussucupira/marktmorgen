/**
 * IndexNow: telling search engines at once that a page of this site exists.
 *
 * Bing, Yandex, Seznam, Naver and Yep read one shared protocol
 * (indexnow.org): a site posts the addresses it wants read to
 * api.indexnow.org, and proves it owns them with a key it serves at its own
 * root. Google does not take part; it reads the sitemap (app/sitemap.ts).
 *
 * What is announced is the sitemap and nothing else, so a page asked to be
 * kept out of search (noindex) or a creator's store is never sent: the
 * sitemap already leaves those out. Each address is announced once, the
 * first day the daily job sees it; the engines then come back to it on their
 * own, through the same sitemap. Announcing every page every day, or on every
 * deploy, is what the protocol asks sites not to do.
 *
 * The key is public by design (the engines fetch it from the site), so it
 * lives here and in public/<key>.txt, which tests/indexnow.test.ts holds equal.
 *
 *   nl:indexnow:sent    the addresses already announced, a set
