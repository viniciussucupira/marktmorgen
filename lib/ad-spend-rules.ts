/**
 * What the creator spent on ads, set against what each channel brought
 * (added 11 October 2026). Pure, so the studio's panel, the server and the
 * tests read it the same way; kept by lib/ad-spend.ts.
 *
 * Revenue alone says where money came from; it does not say where money was
 * made. A channel that brought $900 on $1,200 of ads lost $300, and only the
 * creator knows the $1,200. So they type it in — the channel, a post or
 * campaign if they like, the amount, and the days it ran — and each channel's
 * row gains what was spent, what is left, and how much came back for each
 * dollar. Typed, not read from the ad networks: nothing to connect, nothing
 * of the creator's handed to anybody, and it works for a sponsor paid by
 * transfer as well as for Meta.
 *
 * An amount that ran over several days is spread evenly over them, and a
 * window is charged the part of it that fell inside. Amounts are in the
 * store's currency, in its smallest unit, like every other figure there.
