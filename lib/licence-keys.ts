/**
 * License keys: one unique key handed to each buyer of a product.
 *
 * For a creator who sells software, a plugin, a preset pack that unlocks
 * with a code, or seats in something they run elsewhere. They choose where
 * the keys come from:
 *
 *   - a pool they upload — a text or CSV file of keys their own system made,
 *     up to 10,000 at a time and 10,000 waiting at once — handed out one per
 *     sale in the order they were uploaded;
 *   - or keys made here, in a shape they set: a prefix and groups of letters
 *     and digits, like STUDIO-7K2Q-9XFD-M3PL. The alphabet leaves out the
 *     letters and digits people misread (0 and O, 1 and I), and the shortest
 *     key allowed has twelve random characters, which is 60 bits: nobody
 *     guesses one.
 *
 * The rule the whole file is built around is that a key is never given twice.
 * A pool is a Redis list and a key leaves it with one LPOP, which Redis does
 * atomically: two buyers paying in the same millisecond get two different
 * keys. A sale is given its key with HSETNX, so a sale that is looked at from
 * two places at once — the thanks page and the five-minute job that sends
 * the confirmation email — gets one key, and the loser of that race puts the
 * key it popped back at the front of the pool. A made key is only kept if
 * SADD says nobody has had it before. Every key ever uploaded or made is kept
 * in that set, so an upload that repeats an old key has the repeat skipped
 * rather than handed to a second buyer.
 *
 * The buyer sees their key on the thanks page, in the confirmation email and
 * on their list of purchases. The creator sees every key given, to whom and
 * for which sale, and can mark one revoked, which the public check
 * (/api/store/licence) then reports, so the creator's own software can refuse
 * it. A sale refunded in full in Stripe has its key revoked by itself: the
 * five-minute job reads the refunds on the creator's account and marks the
 * key, the same rule every other door uses (lib/refunds.ts). Nothing here can
 * reach into that software: revoking is a record the creator's app has to
 * ask about.
 *
 * When a pool runs low the creator is emailed once, and again after each
 * top-up; when it is empty the product shows as sold out and no checkout is
 * opened. A buyer who paid in the moment the last key went is not left with
 * nothing: their sale waits, the creator is told who is waiting, and the
 * next upload gives them a key and emails it to them.
 *
 *   nl:keys:<store>:<product>:pool     list of keys not yet given
 *   nl:keys:<store>:<product>:all      set of every key ever added or made
 *   nl:keys:<store>:<product>:sale     hash sale reference -> key
 *   nl:keys:<store>:<product>:info     hash key -> who, when, which sale, revoked
 *   nl:keys:<store>:<product>:waiting  hash sale reference -> buyer waiting for a key
 *   nl:keys:<store>:<product>:warned   set once the low-pool email has gone
 *
 * <store> is the store's statsId, which follows it through a new address and
 * a new sign-in email.
