/**
 * An account's recovery address (added 13 October 2026): a second inbox the
 * creator confirmed with a code sent to it, for the day they can no longer open
 * the one they log in with. Nobody here unlocks an account by hand, so this —
 * with a passkey, which needs no email at all — is how a creator who lost their
 * email gets back in.
 *
 * From /signin/lost they type their sign-in address; when it has a recovery
 * address, a link goes there (the answer on the page is the same either way,
 * so it says nothing about who has an account). The link lets them in at once:
 *
 *   - with two-step login on, it leads to the code page like the emailed link
 *     does, and a right code or a passkey opens everything; "Get in now" opens
 *     the studio with what matters locked (lib/two-step.ts enterLocked);
 *   - without it, the studio opens with what matters locked for LOCK_DAYS —
 *     payments, the plan, the team, exports, settings, sending to the list,
 *     imports, the sign-in address, passkeys and two-step login — and then
 *     everything opens, the sign-in address included, so they can move it to an
 *     inbox they have. A login with the sign-in inbox, a passkey or a code
 *     before then logs those sessions out and ends the lock.
 *
 * The lock is what keeps an old recovery inbox that somebody else got into
 * from becoming a quiet way to take the store: the sign-in address is told at
 * once, and its owner has the week to answer.
 *
 *   nl:auth:rec:<hash>        the account's recovery address
