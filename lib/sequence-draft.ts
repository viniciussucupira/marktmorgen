/**
 * A sequence's emails drafted with AI (added 11 October 2026): the rules,
 * which the studio's browser reads too. The part that asks the model is in
 * lib/ai.ts (writeSequence); a sequence itself is lib/flows.ts.
 *
 * The two starter sequences (lib/mail-starters.ts) are the same words for
 * every store. This writes a sequence for the moment the creator picks — a
 * welcome, the days after somebody gets one product, the first purchase —
 * from what the store really sells: its products' names, summaries, prices
 * and links, and anything the creator types. Kajabi, Kit and Beacons draft
 * sequences with AI; Stan drafts single emails.
 *
 * What holds it to the store's own standard:
 *
 *   - Only the store's own links. A line of a drafted email that holds an
 *     address other than the store's (its page, its orders page, a product's
 *     page) is taken out, so a sequence never sends a reader somewhere invented.
 *   - The waits are kept to what a sequence can hold and to a sensible pace:
 *     the first email within a day, each later one 1 to 14 days after the one
 *     before.
 *   - Nothing is saved or switched on. The emails land in the sequence being
 *     edited; the creator reads them and presses Save the sequence.
