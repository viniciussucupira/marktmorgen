/**
 * The window every monthly allowance of a store is counted in (added 17
 * October 2026).
 *
 * Until then every allowance reset on the 1st (UTC), while a subscription's
 * period starts on whatever day the creator first paid. One payment then
 * covered the tail of one calendar month and the head of the next, so a
 * store could use two months of every allowance for the price of one, and
 * the per-plan worst month (tests/plan-cost-registry.ts) was a month that a
 * payment does not buy. Now:
 *
 *   - A store that pays us counts its allowances in its own billing month:
 *     the period Stripe last told us it paid for, for a monthly plan, and
 *     the same period cut into twelve months on the day it began, for a
 *     yearly one (a yearly plan's allowances are monthly, like the price it
 *     is ten of). One payment, one window: what tests/plan-cost-model.ts
 *     prices.
 *   - The window is named by the UTC day it starts ("2026-10-19"), so two
 *     windows of one subscription never share a name, and none of them shares
 *     one with a calendar month ("2026-10"). Two windows that start on the
 *     same day (a plan moved to yearly the day it renewed) share one: the
 *     store gets the rest of the same allowance, never a second one.
 *   - A store in its free trial counts the trial as one window, from the day
 *     it began (TRIAL_DAYS before it ends) to its end, so a trial that
 *     crosses the 1st is still one trial's allowance.
 *   - A store that pays nothing otherwise (no plan, a plan that ended), and
 *     a store given a plan with no subscription behind it (the demo store),
 *     keeps the calendar month: there is no payment to follow. What stores
 *     that pay nothing cost is a funded exposure with its own shared ceiling
 *     (lib/free-pool-rules.ts), not a plan's worst month.
 *   - Unknown is closed. A store that pays but whose period we do not have
 *     (a record from before this was kept) has no window, and every costly
 *     use that asks for one is refused until the studio or the daily job
 *     (lib/billing-sync.ts) reads the period from Stripe. Stripe moves a
 *     renewing subscription into its next period on the day the last one
 *     ends; the snapshot learns it when the studio is opened or the daily
 *     job runs, so for RENEW_GRACE_SECONDS after a period's end the next
 *     window (which starts exactly there) is used, and after that nothing.
 *     A period set to end with no renewal gets no such grace.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network: pages that print when an allowance
 * opens again read the same window the counters do.
