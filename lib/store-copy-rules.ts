/**
 * Copying a whole store into another store of the same account (added 18
 * October 2026; HighLevel's snapshots, docs/zero-cost-value-2026-10-18.md
 * item 4). The rules, pure: what comes across, what never does, what a copy
 * needs in the other store, and the words that say so before anything is
 * written. lib/store-copy.ts reads the stores and writes the copy.
 *
 * What comes across, into the other store, as drafts:
 *
 *   - the products (their words, prices, schedules, checkout questions,
 *     boxes at checkout, offers after paying, pairings, long descriptions and
 *     pages of blocks), each kept back from the store until the creator
 *     publishes it;
 *   - the store's own pages, out of the menu and kept back from visitors;
 *   - the forms, quizzes and surveys, without a single answer;
 *   - the funnels of pages, off;
 *   - and, only when the creator asks for it, the store page's setup: the
 *     about line, the colors and letters, the links, the social profiles,
 *     the questions and answers, the order of its parts, its sections and
 *     its line of news.
 *
 * What never comes across: customers, orders, contacts, emails, answers to
 * forms, reviews, numbers, payments, payout details, the Stripe or PayPal
 * account, taxes, the domain, the sender of emails and its postal address,
 * the team, integrations and keys, licence keys, and every file and picture
 * (they are the first store's storage). A product whose whole point lives in
 * one of those (a call on the creator's calendar, a course's lessons, a
 * private podcast, options that each deliver their own thing, licence keys)
 * is not copied, and the preview names each.
 *
 * Nothing is cut to fit: when the other store has no room for the whole
 * copy (products, pages, forms, funnels, its data room, its studio requests
 * this month), the preview says which and nothing is written.
