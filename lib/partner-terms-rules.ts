/**
 * How long a partnership lasts, who may change it and what it went through
 * (630 [HN6](39), unit 1; owner's Hotmart audit). A partner's share
 * (lib/partner-share.ts) runs either to a date the creator chose or "until
 * revoked". Once agreed, the creator cannot change it alone: a new
 * percentage, other products or another end waits for the partner's yes,
 * and a share that runs to a date cannot be ended before it without that yes
 * either. Only a share "until revoked" can be ended by the creator alone,
 * because that is what both agreed to. Either way, what was already earned is
 * never touched: each earning keeps the percentage it was made at.
 *
 * Every step is kept in a short history both of them can read: started,
 * changed, ended, revoked, a change the store took back, and a change the
 * partner declined or that expired unanswered.
 *
 * Pure and browser-safe. Unit 2 keeps the waiting change and the history on
 * the partner's record (lib/affiliates.ts proposePartnerShare and
 * answerShareChange), checking the cap again when the partner says yes;
 * unit 3 wires the studio's route and screen and asks the partner on their
 * own page, together, so no screen says "saved" while a change waits.
