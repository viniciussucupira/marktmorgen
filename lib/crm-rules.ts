/**
 * Fields of a store's own about each person, and its deals (added 13 October
 * 2026): the two parts of a CRM a creator who sells calls, coaching or
 * services asks for, and the two ClickFunnels sells as contact attributes and
 * opportunities.
 *
 *   - A field is a question the creator keeps the answer to for each person:
 *     their company, their time zone, the date of a first call, which offer
 *     interests them. Up to MAX_CRM_FIELDS, each text, a number, a date or one
 *     of a few choices. Filled in on the person's page in the studio, and
 *     written into the file of the list as columns of their own.
 *   - A deal is somebody the creator is talking to about a sale that does not
 *     happen at a checkout (a coaching package, a custom project), with what
 *     it is worth and the stage it has reached. The stages are the creator's,
 *     each open, won or lost, and the board adds up each.
 *
 * Nothing here is read by anybody but the store's own team, and nothing here
 * sends anything to anybody: a deal is a note that adds up, never a message.
 *
 * Pure and browser-safe: the studio and the routes read these rules.
