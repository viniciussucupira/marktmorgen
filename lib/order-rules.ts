/**
 * Orders a store hands over, and what a plan covers of them: the rules.
 *
 * Every order costs us something however small it is: the email that
 * confirms it (and, for a physical product, the one that says it was
 * shipped), the pages and the jobs that settle it, the writes to the
 * database. About a fifth of a cent all told (tests/plan-margin.test.ts has
 * the sum). It went into no limit at all, because the receipts were counted
 * as a fixed number of emails in each plan's worst month. A store that sells
 * a hundred thousand copies of a video in a month on a plan with no share
 * of its sales would cost more than that plan brings in, and a free product
 * given away to that many addresses would cost the same with nothing paid
 * at all.
 *
 * So orders are covered and priced the way visits are (lib/traffic-rules.ts):
 *
 *   - An order is one purchase confirmed (whatever it holds, a bundle or a
 *     cart of several products included), one offer taken after paying, one
 *     place taken in a purchase made for several people, and one free copy
 *     sent to an address. Counted once, however often it is looked at
 *     (lib/orders.ts).
 *   - An order that paid a share of its sale (lib/platform-share.ts) is
 *     covered by that share and is not counted: the smallest share there is,
 *     on the smallest payment Stripe takes, is several times what the order
 *     costs. While no share is taken, every order counts.
 *   - Every plan covers a number of orders in a calendar month
 *     (ORDERS_INCLUDED), more on a larger plan.
 *   - Since 17 October 2026 orders past that are not sold. They were billed
 *     at ORDER_CENTS_PER_THOUSAND_OVER, half a cent an order, against about a
 *     fifth of a cent of cost: more than the 17.2% of a price a cost may be
 *     and still leave the owner's 60% after a 27.5% tax. The price is not
 *     changed; it is no longer charged. Instead a paid store's new orders stop
 *     at its plan's figure (lib/order-admission.ts): every checkout, cart,
 *     tip, offer after paying, PayPal order, purchase for several people and
 *     free copy is admitted only while the month's orders, with the checkouts
 *     opened in the last day that may still be paid, are under the figure. A
 *     buyer past it is told plainly that the store is not taking new orders
 *     right now and nothing is charged; a checkout already open is never cut
 *     off, so a buyer in the middle of paying finishes, and gets everything.
 *   - A store in its free trial has no invoice to add an order to. A paid
 *     order there still costs its buyer a card payment, which nobody runs up
 *     for fun; a free copy costs nobody anything, so free copies in a trial
 *     stop at TRIAL_ORDERS a month (lib/free.ts), until the plan is paid or
 *     the month turns. A store with no plan gives no free copies at all.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network or a secret: the pages that publish
 * these figures read the same ones the bill is made from.

 * sell at an ordinary conversion rate (250 of Store's 2,850 public visits is
 * almost 9%, 750 of Studio's 9,500 about 8%). The same day, when the uses

 * almost 5% of their public visits.
