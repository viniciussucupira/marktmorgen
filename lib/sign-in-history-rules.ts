/**
 * The creator's sign-in history (630 [HN6], item 33, unit 1; added
 * 3 November 2026): the rules, browser-safe. Writing an entry at each
 * sign-in (lib/auth.ts noteSignIn, which already tells the creator about a
 * new browser), the list in the studio beside "Sign out everywhere" (already
 * there, app/api/auth/signout-all), and the privacy policy's sentence are the
 * next unit; keeping the list needs a key family of its own
 * (lib/data-families.ts).
 *
 *   - Each entry says when; how the creator got in (`way`: the ways lib/auth.ts
 *     names, plus "rescue", the link to the recovery address that turned
 *     two-step login off, app/api/auth/rescue; "locked", a session opened
 *     without the second step and held back from what LOCKED_NOTE says; and
 *     "move", the session the change of sign-in address opens); apart from
 *     it, which address the way went through (`via`: the sign-in address or
 *     the recovery address, so a session opened from the recovery inbox is
 *     never shown as a plain login link); the second step used (lib/two-step.ts:
 *     a code from the app, a recovery code, or none; a passkey is its own
 *     check); the browser as browserName says it ("Chrome on macOS", never the
 *     full user agent); and the approximate place the hosting's own headers
 *     give (a city and a country, cleaned; never the IP address, which is not
 *     kept). The country is kept as its two-letter code and shown by its
 *     English name (Intl.DisplayNames), never as the bare code (AX274 3.1.4).
 *   - At most MAX_SIGN_INS entries, newest first, none shown older than
 *     SIGN_IN_DAYS: enough to see a sign-in that was not yours, small enough
 *     to hold little about the creator.
 *   - How long it is kept, honestly: one sorted set per person, scored by
 *     `at`. Each sign-in drops the entries SIGN_IN_DAYS old or more and all
 *     but the newest MAX_SIGN_INS, and sets the whole set to expire
 *     SIGN_IN_DAYS later. So an entry is shown at most SIGN_IN_DAYS, and is
 *     stored until the next sign-in after that or until the set expires,
 *     which is never more than twice SIGN_IN_DAYS after it was written.
 *     The privacy policy must say "up to 180 days" (2 x SIGN_IN_DAYS), not 90.
 *   - Kept in the platform's own database, shown only to the creator, in
 *     their own studio; never to a team member about another person.
 *   - The place comes from the internet address and is approximate; the
 *     browser is what the device reported. The list says both (SIGN_IN_NOTES).
 *
 * What the unit that writes and shows it must do:
 *   - Key: one sorted set per person, named from a hash of the NORMALISED
 *     sign-in email, exactly as the remembered browsers are
 *     (lib/auth.ts devicesKey: the devices prefix + sha256Hex of a prefix and
 *     normaliseEmail(email), cut to 40 hex), with its own prefix and its own
 *     hash input; never the email in clear in a key or a member.
 *   - Read the place headers only on the hosting that sets them
 *     (process.env.VERCEL === "1", as lib/bot-check.ts does), never from a
 *     client elsewhere, after checking the hosting's official, dated docs.
 *     Check there too whether x-vercel-ip-city encodes a space as "+":
 *     decodeURIComponent leaves "+" as it is, placeFrom then refuses the
 *     city and keeps the country only (left out, never guessed); if Vercel
 *     uses "+", turn it into a space before placeFrom, with a test.
 *   - Write each sign-in with signInWrite's commands, all in ONE MULTI/EXEC
 *     transaction (Upstash's /multi-exec). This is required, not a choice:
 *     lib/redis.ts has only the pipeline today, which is not atomic, so the
 *     unit adds the call; a pipeline is never acceptable here, because a
 *     ZADD that lands without its EXPIRE leaves a set with no end. That unit
 *     tests the failure of EXPIRE (and of each other command): the whole
 *     write is undone or never applied, never a set left without expiry.
 *     In a key family of its own, its cost counted per sign-in.
 *   - Write the entry's way from what really happened, never "link" for
 *     everything as noteSignIn's callers pass today:
 *       app/api/auth/lost/confirm (the "lost" link sent to the recovery
 *       address) has three paths, and throughLostLink names each: two-step
 *       login on, the code page then writes "link" via "recovery" with the
 *       code used, or "locked" via "recovery" when the code page's reset is
 *       used; no two-step login and a recovery lock running, "locked" via
 *       "recovery"; no two-step login and no lock, "link" via "recovery".
 *       app/api/auth/code needs to know the hold came through the recovery
 *       address: CONTRACT for the next unit, lib/two-step.ts finishSignIn
 *       answers `viaRecovery` beside `byGoogle` (its hold already keeps `v`),
 *       and the reset reads heldInfo(held).viaRecovery before enterLocked
 *       spends the hold. That change belongs to lib/two-step.ts and is not
 *       made in this unit. app/api/auth/rescue writes "rescue" via "recovery".
 *   - The change of sign-in address IS a sign-in: app/api/auth/move ends
 *     every session of the old address and opens a new one with
 *     openSession(moved.to), without noteSignIn today; a session opened is
 *     a way in, so it is written as "move" via "sign-in", second step none,
 *     said "with the link that changed your sign-in address". The move must
 *     also take the history with it, beside moveDevices
 *     (app/api/auth/move/route.ts, the Promise.all with moveDevices): the
 *     old address's set is moved to the new address's key and the old key
 *     deleted, in one transaction, before the "move" entry is written to the
 *     new key; if moving fails, the old key is deleted, never left behind.
 *   - Read with signInRead's commands and show only what signInsToShow
 *     keeps, which applies the same age and count limits again, so nothing
 *     older than SIGN_IN_DAYS is shown even if a write was missed.
 *   - Delete it with the account, where the remembered browsers
 *     (lib/auth.ts devicesKey) are; put it in the creator's own export; say it in
 *     the privacy policy (lib/person-data.ts).
 *   - Not show it in a locked session (lib/two-step.ts LOCKED_NEEDS), which
 *     may be somebody who got into the sign-in or the recovery inbox.
