/**
 * Forms, surveys and quizzes (added 13 October 2026): questions a creator
 * asks on one of their own pages, and the answers kept for them.
 *
 * ClickFunnels sells a form or a survey as a step of a funnel, and an
 * application before a call is one of its funnel types. Here a form is made
 * once in the studio (/studio/forms) and placed on any of the store's own
 * pages with a "Form" block, so a page that is a step of a funnel asks its
 * questions there and, once they are answered, leads on to the next step.
 *
 * A quiz is a form with results: each answer to a choice may point at one of
 * the results, and the result the most answers point at is shown, with a
 * product of the creator's when they chose one for it. That is a sum anyone
 * could check by hand, written down here; nothing scores a person in secret.
 *
 * A scored quiz (added 17 October 2026) adds points instead: each option
 * of a choice carries 0 to MAX_POINTS points, optionally counted in one of
 * up to MAX_CATEGORIES categories too; a person's total is the sum of the
 * points of the options they chose, and their result is the one whose score
 * range holds that total. The ranges must cover every score from 0 to the
 * highest possible with no gap and no overlap (tierIssues), and the studio
 * will not save a scored quiz until they do. The result page says the score
 * and the range it fell in, so a person can see why they got their result.
 * Points are never negative: a total runs from 0 up, and a range is easy to
 * read.
 *
 * Branching (added 13 October 2026, as ClickFunnels' survey workflows do):
 * an answer to a one-choice question may lead on to a later question,
 * skipping those between, or end the form there. Only forward, so nobody is
 * ever sent round in a circle. Questions a person's answers skip are not
 * asked of them, need no answer and keep none; and an answer that ends a
 * quiz decides its result when it points at one, since nothing after it was
 * asked. With JavaScript off every question shows, and the same rules are
 * applied when the answers arrive (pathOf).
 *
 * What it never does:
 *
 *   - Put anybody on the creator's list for answering. A form may offer a box
 *     to hear from the creator, empty until it is checked, and checking it
 *     sends the same email the store's sign-up box sends (lib/store-join.ts):
 *     the address joins only once its owner presses the button in it.
 *   - Ask for a card number, a password or anything of the kind: there is no
 *     field for it, and the help says not to ask.
 *   - Keep more than it has to: the answers, when, and which page they came
 *     from. Not the connection they came from.
 *
 * Pure and browser-safe: the studio's editor, the block that draws a form and
 * the route that takes the answers all read these rules.
