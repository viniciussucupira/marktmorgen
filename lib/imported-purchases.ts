/**
 * Buyers a creator brought over from another platform: people who paid for a
 * course or a download somewhere else, and keep it here without paying again.
 *
 * Every other purchase on Marktmorgen is read from the creator's own Stripe account
 * (lib/buyer-orders.ts): Stripe is the ledger. These never went through Stripe
 * — nothing was charged, and no receipt exists — so they are the one kind of
 * purchase written down here, and they are always shown for what they are:
 * "Brought over from another platform", never as a sale. They are not counted
 * in the store's numbers, sent to webhooks, credited to affiliates or
 * reviewed, because none of those can be true of them.
 *
 * What one gives is what a purchase of that product gives on the list of
 * purchases (/orders): its file or its link, its course, and for a bundle each
 * of its products — and, when the product (or one in the bundle) opens the
 * store's community, the community (lib/community-access.ts). License keys
 * are not handed out for them: a buyer who had a key on the old platform
 * still has it there.
 *
 *   nl:imp:buy:<statsId>:<address hash>  product id -> { at, job, items }
 *   nl:imp:who:<statsId>                  address -> when it was first brought over: the buyers an import
 *                                         brought, for the list's groups as history, never as a sale (lib/segments.ts)
 *
 * One entry per product and address, written only if there is none (HSETNX),
 * so importing the same file twice gives nobody anything twice.
 *
 * The same record carries two kinds of purchase that did not go through the
 * creator's Stripe either, told apart by `job`: "gift:<id>", a gift paid for
 * by someone else (lib/gifts.ts), and "paypal:<order>", a purchase paid into
 * the creator's own PayPal account (lib/paypal-sales.ts). Each is shown for
 * what it is on the list of purchases, never as brought over.
