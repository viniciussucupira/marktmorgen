/**
 * Companies as records in the CRM: 639 [GL7](4), unit 1. A company the
 * creator sells to as a team (a school, a business buying seats) has a name,
 * a website and a note, and the people who work there, each linked by the
 * same key their tasks and fields are kept under (lib/person-key.ts), never
 * by their address. A person belongs to one company at most: linking them to
 * another moves them.
 *
 *   nl:crm:co:<statsId>   hash: <company id> -> the company, as JSON
 *   nl:crm:co:lock:<statsId>   held for at most 10 seconds while one change is written
 *
 * One change at a time (the lock): two people saving at once never write
 * over each other, and a person linked to two companies at once is never
 * left in both. The second change is refused ("busy") and writes nothing.
 * The write itself lands only while the lock still holds this change's token
 * (WRITE_COMPANIES, one step in Redis): a change held up past the lock's 10
 * seconds, while another went through, is refused ("busy") instead of
 * writing back what it read over the newer one.
 *
 * The store's data room counts what the companies weigh as they are kept
 * (one slot, moved by what each change grows or shrinks the hash by, read
 * from the records as they are, unreadable ones included): taken first when
 * a change grows it, given back when its lock was lost and nothing landed,
 * and after a change or a deletion that shrinks it. A write that fails
 * without saying whether it landed keeps what it took: the room may count a
 * little more than is kept, never less, and the change is answered
 * "unconfirmed", never "saved" (Codex G2, #2574: only Redis's exact 1 is
 * written, only its exact 0 is nothing written). What is read back is checked
 * again, and only Redis's own answers count: a reply that is not one, whole,
 * is CompaniesUnreadable, never "no companies";
 * a person deleted from the store is taken off every company
 * (forgetCompanyPerson, from forgetCrmPerson in lib/crm.ts).
