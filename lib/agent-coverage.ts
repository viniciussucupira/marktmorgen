/**
 * Every action of the studio, and how an AI agent reaches it: 631 [AA1],
 * step (a), unit 1 (owner, 2 November 2026, 02h15 Fortaleza: "a loja inteira
 * controlada por um agente de IA").
 *
 * The goal of the item is that anything a creator does in the studio can be
 * done by an agent: the assistant inside the studio, the creator's own Claude
 * or ChatGPT through the MCP server (app/api/mcp/route.ts), and a command line,
 * all on the same API, under the same role permissions (lib/team-roles.ts) and
 * the same plan limits. This table is the measure of that goal. Each studio
 * route — a route under app/api that passes one of the studio's own guards
 * (lib/store-request.ts, lib/studio-route.ts) — is listed once per method with
 * one of:
 *
 *   - "tool": an MCP tool already does it today, named here;
 *   - "read", "draft" or "execute": not built yet, and the kind of agent key
 *     it will need (631 (c): keys for reading, for preparing changes and for
 *     carrying them out). "draft" is a change the agent prepares as a preview
 *     the creator confirms; "execute" reaches people outside the studio or
 *     cannot be taken back (an email sent, a buyer answered, an import), so it
 *     is confirmed one at a time;
 *   - "never": the agent will not do it, and why. Money is never moved by the
 *     agent (631 (c)); who is let into the store, secrets and files of buyers'
 *     addresses never pass through an assistant's conversation, which is kept
 *     by whoever runs the assistant (app/api/mcp/route.ts); and a page another
 *     service sends the creator's browser back to has nothing to call.
 *
 * tests/agent-coverage.test.ts reads every route file and fails when a studio
 * route or method is missing here, when a row names a route that is gone,
 * when a tool named here is not served by the MCP server, or when a money
 * route is not "never". So a new studio action cannot be added without saying
 * how the agent reaches it.
 *
 * Nothing here is a tool, a permission or a promise to a customer: it is the
 * inventory the next units build from, and the public page of 631 (e) waits
 * until the rows are tools that work (rule VR).
