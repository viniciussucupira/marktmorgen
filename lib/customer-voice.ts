/**
 * What customers are saying (added 12 October 2026): the month's words from
 * a store's customers, sorted by a model into the few themes they repeat,
 * each with how many said it and their own words beside it.
 *
 * Read before it was built: ChartMogul AI pulls the reasons for cancelling
 * out of notes and emails; Contentsquare's Voice of Customer (Hotjar) writes
 * an AI summary of open answers with their sentiment; Baremetrics'
 * Cancellation Insights groups the reasons members give; Amplitude's
 * feedback agent groups feedback into themes and sends them on a schedule.
 * Here four lists the studio already keeps, each shown on its own, are read
 * together:
 *
 *   - what members wrote when cancelling (lib/membership-numbers.ts);
 *   - questions a product page or the store's guide could not answer
 *     (lib/answers.ts);
 *   - the words of reviews (lib/reviews.ts);
 *   - what was searched for on the store and found nothing (lib/stats.ts).
 *
 * From the last 90 days. The model only sorts: it is handed the texts by
 * number and returns a short name for each theme and the numbers that belong
 * to it. The counts are worked out here from those numbers, and the
 * examples shown are the texts themselves, so nothing a creator reads under
 * a theme was written by the model except its name.
 *
 * Nobody is named. The texts go without a name, and any email address, phone
 * number or web address in them is taken out before they are sent.
 *
 * One of the month's AI jobs (lib/ai.ts, counted), on the smaller model,
 * made only when the creator asks, at most once a calendar month, and only
 * when there are at least MIN_TEXTS texts to sort.
 *
 *   nl:voice:<statsId>:<yyyy-mm>   the month's summary, about two months
 *   nl:voice:lock:<statsId>         one reading at a time, a minute
