/**
 * Webhooks: telling the creator's other tools what happened in their store.
 *
 * A creator adds up to MAX_ENDPOINTS https addresses — a Zapier "Catch Hook",
 * a Make or n8n webhook, their own server — and picks which events each one
 * hears. When one of those things happens, a JSON message is POSTed to it:
 *
 *   sale.completed       a paid checkout on the store (any product, calls and
 *                        memberships included), or a one-click extra after it
 *   membership.started   a membership bought (not a payment plan)
 *   membership.canceled  a membership set to end, or ended
 *   lead.captured        someone confirmed their address for a free product
 *                        (the link in the email was used)
 *   list.joined          someone confirmed their address to join the store's
 *                        list, from its sign-up box, one of its forms or the
 *                        checkout script on the creator's own site
 *   call.booked          a call or a seat in a session booked and paid
 *   call.moved           a buyer moved their booking
 *   refund.issued        a refund made on the creator's Stripe account
 *   membership.changed   a membership moved to another price or quantity on
 *                        the creator's Stripe account (630 [HN6](18))
 *   dispute.opened       a buyer disputed a payment the store's checkout made
 *                        (630 [HN6](18))
 *
 * The first four about money, and these last two, are read from the creator's own Stripe account,
 * which is the ledger, by the five-minute job (watchStripe): its events are
 * walked from where the last run stopped, so a refund made in the Stripe
 * dashboard is noticed on the next run, within about five minutes. A refund
 * or a dispute names only a payment: whose it is is read off the payment,
 * or, for a membership's or a payment plan's charge, off the invoice it paid
 * (paymentMeta), within a bounded number of calls per run. An event whose
 * store could not be told in a run (a call failed, or the run's calls ran
 * out) is not passed over: the anchor stays before it, and the next run reads
 * it again. The other three happen in our own code and are sent the moment
 * they happen.
 *
 * Every event has an id made from what it is about — the checkout, the
 * subscription, the refund — so however many times the same thing is noticed
 * (the thanks page and the job, a run that repeats), it is sent once. Every
 * message is signed: the header Marktmorgen-Signature is "t=<seconds>,v1=<hex>",
 * where the hex is HMAC-SHA256 of "<seconds>.<body>" under the endpoint's
 * secret, which is shown to the creator once, when the endpoint is added. A
 * receiver checks the signature and that the time is recent, and uses the
 * event id to ignore a repeat.
 *
 * A message is tried at once, and when the endpoint does not answer 2xx, again
 * after RETRY_MINUTES (5 minutes, 15, 1 hour, 3, 12, 24): seven tries over
 * about forty hours, then it is marked failed. Retries ride the five-minute
 * job, a bounded number per run. Since 18 October 2026 every try, the first,
 * each retry and each test, is one of the store's webhook deliveries for its
 * month (lib/store-allowance-rules.ts), taken before the endpoint is called:
 * once they are used, a delivery is not tried, and is marked failed with the
 * reason, which the studio's log shows. The last LOG_SIZE deliveries of a store are
 * kept for its studio, with what the endpoint answered; each is kept for a
 * week at most. Every request goes through lib/safe-fetch.ts, so an endpoint
 * on a private network is refused, and none follows a redirect.
 *
 *   nl:hooks:cfg:<statsId>      { handle, endpoints, since }
 *   nl:hooks:stores             the stores that have any endpoint

 *   nl:hooks:d:<delivery>       one delivery and how it went, for a week
 *   nl:hooks:log:<statsId>      the store's last deliveries, newest first
 *   nl:hooks:q                  deliveries waiting for a try, by when
 *   nl:hooks:anchor:<statsId>   the last Stripe event read for this store
