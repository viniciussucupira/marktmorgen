/**
 * What every module keeps about a store's people, and what deleting one of
 * them does to it (added 17 October 2026) — the erasure's counterpart of the
 * cost registry (tests/plan-cost-registry.ts).
 *
 * tests/person-data-registry.test.ts reads the code for every file that may
 * keep something per person (tests/person-data-scan.ts) and fails until that
 * file is here, and fails when an entry says a module is erased by a
 * function that lib/person-erasure.ts does not run. So a module that starts
 * keeping something about a person cannot ship without saying, here, how it
 * is deleted, or why it is kept.
 *
 * The studio's confirmation and the person's own page read the "erased",
 * "kept", "suppression", "expires" and "open" lines below, so what they say
 * is what the code does. Each line is US English, written for the creator.
 *
 *   erased       deleted by the erasure, through the module named in `via`
 *                (the file itself when not given), one of lib/person-erasure.ts ERASERS
 *   suppression  the one-way fingerprint kept so they are never emailed again
 *   kept         kept on purpose, with the reason, and only the fields named
 *   expires      found only by a link's own token; gone by itself within `days`,
 *                and never acted on for a deleted address
 *   open         not reached by the erasure yet; said before anyone deletes
 *   account      a creator's or teammate's own sign-in and account, not a store's people
 *   none         found by the scan, and keeps nothing about a store's people
