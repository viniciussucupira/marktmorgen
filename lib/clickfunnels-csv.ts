/**
 * Moving from ClickFunnels, the spreadsheet half (added 17 October 2026):
 * how the files a ClickFunnels workspace owner exports read here. See
 * docs/clickfunnels-import.md for what ClickFunnels' own help center says
 * each export holds, and when it was read.
 *
 * ClickFunnels lets the owner export three things as a file, each from its
 * own page, choosing the fields: contacts, products and orders. None of its
 * help pages lists every column name, so nothing here depends on one name:
 * each field below is matched by the names ClickFunnels' screens and help
 * pages use for it, then by the ordinary names any platform uses, and the
 * creator sees the match and can change it before anything is read.
 *
 * Consent is the part that matters most. ClickFunnels marks each contact
 * Subscribed, Unsubscribed or Undeliverable, and asks whoever imports
 * contacts into it to confirm they agreed to marketing. Here:
 *
 *   - only a row marked Subscribed, in a file whose importer confirms those
 *     people agreed, comes in as someone the creator may email;
 *   - every other row comes in as a contact the creator cannot email: kept
 *     with their name and tags, never written to because of the import;
 *   - a row marked Unsubscribed or Undeliverable keeps that here too: the
 *     address is marked as having left, so no later import can make it one
 *     the creator emails. Only that person, ticking a box on one of the
 *     creator's pages, can.
 *
 * Pure and browser-safe: the studio's screen and the server read the same.
