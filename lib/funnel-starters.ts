/**
 * Starter funnels (added 17 October 2026): whole funnels with Marktmorgen's
 * own starting words, in the same file format a creator shares
 * (lib/funnel-bundle.ts), so a starter is previewed, mapped to the
 * creator's products and checked exactly like a shared funnel.
 *
 * The funnel types (lib/funnel-types.ts) make empty pages under a title. A
 * starter goes one step further and writes a first draft of the words:
 * headings, the steps of what happens next, the questions buyers ask. Every
 * sentence is one a creator can say truthfully as it stands, or is a
 * placeholder in [brackets] for what only they know. None states a result,
 * a number, a deadline or what somebody said about them, and the pages
 * arrive kept back from visitors until the creator has made them theirs.
