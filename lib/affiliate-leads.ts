/**
 * Pay per lead (added 18 October 2026; HighLevel audit H29): recording the
 * confirmed leads affiliates bring, and the creator's decisions on them. The
 * terms and how a lead stands are in lib/affiliate-lead-rules.ts; the book,
 * the payments and the PayPal batches read the leads with everything else
 * (lib/affiliates.ts readBook), so a lead is paid the way a sale's commission
 * is: by the creator, from their own account, never by Marktmorgen.
 *
 * Where a lead is recorded, always after it was confirmed:
 *
 *   - a sign-up: the button in the emailed link pressed, and the address new
 *     to the list (app/api/store/join/confirm). The affiliate was read from
 *     the visit when the address was typed (lib/store-join.ts, askToJoin) and
 *     travelled in the emailed link;
 *   - a free product: its emailed link used, the first time that address got
 *     that product (app/api/store/free/download, the visit read when it was
 *     asked for, lib/free.ts requestCopy);
 *   - a booking: once Stripe says it is paid (lib/calls.ts confirmBooking),
 *     carried on the checkout from the visit; it counts once its call's time
 *     has passed, it was not refunded and the creator says it took place.
 *
 * What it costs, and where that is counted: a lead is written with a few
 * database commands inside a request that is already counted and priced
 * (tests/plan-cost-registry.ts): a sign-up's confirmation takes one of the
 * store's public requests first (lib/traffic.ts takePublicRequest), and is
 * not credited when the store has none left; a free product and a booking
 * are orders. What it keeps is counted in the store's data room before it is
 * written, and refused past it. No email is sent for a lead.
