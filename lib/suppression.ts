/**
 * The one thing kept about a person a store deleted (added 17 October 2026):
 * a one-way fingerprint of their address, so that store never emails them
 * again (CAN-SPAM's opt-out, the GDPR's objection to direct marketing) and
 * no import, API call or list from another platform puts them back.
 *
 *   nl:erased:<listId>   hash  fingerprint -> when they were deleted (seconds)
 *
 * Kept under the store's list id (lib/contacts.ts), which every path that
 * emails a store's people already reads; deleting somebody gives a store
 * without a list one, so the fingerprint always has a place.
 *
 * The fingerprint is a SHA-256 of the store and the address, cut to 32
 * characters. It cannot be read back into an address; it can only answer
 * "is this address the one that was deleted?" when the address is typed
 * again. It holds nothing else: not their name, not what they bought, not
 * who deleted them.
 *
 * Only the person can lift it, by giving their own yes again: asking for
 * something free and confirming by the emailed link, or ticking the box to
 * hear from the creator when they buy (lib/contacts.ts upsertContact). A
 * creator's import never does.
