/**
 * A buyer's library (added 11 October 2026): everything an address bought
 * from any store on Marktmorgen, in one place, with no account.
 *
 * Each store already gives its buyers their purchases back by email
 * (lib/buyer-orders.ts): type the address you paid with, use the link that
 * arrives. A buyer of five creators had five stores to remember. Gumroad and
 * Kajabi each keep one library per buyer, and their apps are built on it; so
 * is the app this will be.
 *
 * What is kept is the least that can do it: for an address, read only as a
 * one-way hash of it, which stores it bought something from, by the store's
 * id. Not what, not when, not for how much: each store's own list is still
 * read from the creator's Stripe account when the buyer opens it, exactly as
 * before. The privacy page says so.
 *
 * Signing in is the same as a store's: the address is typed, and a link that
 * opens the library for a day is emailed to it. Nothing is sent to an address
 * that bought nothing, and the answer on the page is the same either way, so
 * the form cannot be used to learn who buys from whom.
 *
 *   nl:lib:<quarter>:<hash of the address>         the stores it bought from in that quarter (a set of ids)
 *   nl:lib:link:<hash of a token>                  the address a library link was sent to, for a day
 *   nl:lib:joined:<quarter>:<hash of the address>  the stores whose list it joined itself in that quarter
 *
 * The last (added 17 October 2026) is not shown anywhere: it is how a person
 * asking to be deleted from every store (lib/erasure-request.ts) is found in
 * the stores they joined without buying, by the same one-way hash.
 *
 * Since 18 October 2026 each quarter's set ends QUARTERS_KEPT quarters after
 * the one it was written in, so a store is in a library for at least three
 * years after the last purchase from it (lib/joined-stores.ts says why).
 * Until then one set held them all, kept three years after the last
 * purchase from any store, and is still read until it ends. A store that
 * has closed is never shown: it no longer exists. And only what was bought
 * on Marktmorgen puts a store in: an order, a gift, a place bought for
 * somebody, a pre-order, a PayPal purchase; not what a creator brings over
 * from another platform or gives through the API.
