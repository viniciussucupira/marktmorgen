/**
 * Two-step login (added 13 October 2026): after the emailed link, a six-digit
 * code from an authenticator app (lib/totp.ts), for a creator who turns it on.
 * Off until they do, because the emailed link alone is how everybody here has
 * always logged in, and a second step somebody did not ask for is a door they
 * can be locked out of.
 *
 * What it protects against: somebody who gets into the creator's inbox, or
 * finds a login link in it, still cannot open the studio without the phone.
 *
 * What counts as the second step:
 *
 *   - the code the app shows now, or one step either side for a phone clock a
 *     little off, used once: a code already used does not open anything again;
 *   - one of ten recovery codes, shown once when it is turned on, each good
 *     once and kept only as a hash. Using one emails the account;
 *   - a passkey (lib/passkeys.ts), which already asks the device for its own
 *     check — a fingerprint, a face, a PIN — so it is never asked for a code.
 *
 * Turning it on needs a login from the last fifteen minutes and a right code
 * from the app; turning it off, or making new recovery codes, needs a right
 * code. Each of the three emails the account. Five wrong codes end a waiting
 * login, and an account answers ten codes an hour at most, so six digits
 * cannot be guessed by trying.
 *
 * Nobody is locked out, and nobody here has to unlock anybody by hand. Turning
 * it on asks for a recovery address — a second inbox, confirmed with a code
 * sent to it — and a creator who has lost the phone, the recovery codes and
 * every passkey has a link sent there from the code page: opening it turns
 * two-step login off and logs them in at once. Somebody who got into the
 * sign-in inbox alone cannot, because the link goes to the other one.
 *
 * When the recovery inbox is lost as well (or for an account set up before
 * there was one), the creator still gets in at once, from the same page, with
 * the emailed link alone — into a studio where what could take money, data or
 * the account itself away is locked for RESET_DAYS (LOCKED_NEEDS: payments,
 * the plan, the team, deleting, exports, settings, sending to the list,
 * imports, the sign-in address, passkeys, two-step login). They can sell, edit
 * their products and pages, answer buyers and read their numbers meanwhile.
 * After those days two-step login turns off and nothing is locked. In that
 * time the account is emailed, every browser still logged in shows it, and any
 * login with a right code or a passkey — or one press of Cancel in the studio —
 * calls it off and logs the locked sessions out. So somebody who only has the
 * inbox gets nothing that matters before the owner can see it, and the owner
 * who really lost everything is back at work the same minute, without writing
 * to anyone. Exchanges and banks hold withdrawals after a recovery the same
 * way; NIST SP 800-63B-4 asks for the notices.
 *
 * The app's secret is sealed at rest (lib/secret-box.ts), bound to the
 * account's address, so a copy of the database alone opens nothing. If the
 * deployment's root secret were ever rolled the app's codes could no longer be
 * checked; the recovery codes and passkeys still let the creator in, and the
 * page says so.
 *
 *   nl:2fa:<hash>         the account's record: the sealed secret, when it was
 *                         turned on, the recovery codes' hashes, the last step used
 *   nl:2fa:setup:<hash>   a secret being set up, 10 minutes, tied to the session
 *   nl:2fa:hold:<hash>    a login that has passed the emailed link and waits
 *                         for its code, 10 minutes, tied to a cookie of that browser
 *   nl:2fa:rescue:<hash>  a link sent to the recovery address, 15 minutes, spent once
 *   nl:2fa:locked:<hash>  a session opened without the second step: until when it is locked
 *   nl:2fa:lockedset:<hash> the account's locked sessions, to log them out on Cancel
