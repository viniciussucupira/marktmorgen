/**
 * Every way a run of this workflow stops, in words, read from the workflow
 * itself and the engine's own limits (added 18 October 2026, ClickFunnels
 * audit row F23). The studio shows them beside the preview, before the
 * workflow is switched on.
 *
 * Each rule here is one the scheduled job enforces (lib/flows.ts,
 * sendDueSteps; lib/flow-retry.ts): nothing is listed that the code does not
 * do, and every stop the code makes is listed. A run also always ends after
 * its last step, because routes only go forward (lib/flow-paths.ts).
 *
 * Pure and browser-safe.
