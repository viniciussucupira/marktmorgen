/**
 * Deleting one person from a store's community (added 17 October 2026, for
 * lib/person-erasure.ts): everything the community keeps under their member
 * key, gathered from the modules that keep it, each through its own
 * function.
 *
 *   - their record: address, name, handle, answers to the creator's
 *     questions, the directory and the search index of members;
 *   - their points, rewards and places on the boards;
 *   - what they were told, the devices they let us notify, their private
 *     conversations and requests, what they said in the room and the leave
 *     they held there;
 *   - their answers to whether they are coming to each live event, and the
 *     answers kept about whether they may come in;
 *   - the record behind the unsubscribe link in the announcements they got.
 *
 * What they wrote in the feed — posts, comments, likes, poll votes, reports
 * — is kept by post, not by member, and is not reached from here yet; the
 * registry lists it as open (lib/person-data.ts), and the confirmation says
 * so before anyone deletes.
