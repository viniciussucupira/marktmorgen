/**
 * Captions written by AI for a lesson's video: the rules and the price
 * (added 11 October 2026; lib/auto-captions.ts does it).
 *
 * Captions could be added from a file the creator had (lib/captions.ts), and
 * the studio said plainly that they were not written for you. Most creators
 * have no such file, so most lessons had none: no help for a student who
 * cannot hear, or is on a train, or follows English better read than heard.
 *
 * The video service writes them (Bunny Stream's "Transcribe AI", a Whisper
 * model): in the language spoken, and, if asked, in other languages too. It
 * charges ten cents a minute of video for each language (its price page,
 * read October 11, 2026). Nothing a plan covers has room for that by the
 * hour (tests/plan-margin.test.ts), so it is a thing bought when wanted:
 *
 *   - CENTS_PER_MINUTE a minute of video, for each language, the minutes
 *     rounded up, and never less than MIN_CENTS in all;
 *   - the price is shown before the button is pressed, and charged at once
 *     on the card the plan is paid with (lib/billing.ts, chargeNow), so
 *     nothing is ever owed afterward;
 *   - what the service does not deliver within GIVE_UP_HOURS is refunded,
 *     language by language.
 *
 * At its dearest a minute costs us ten cents for each language asked, and a
 * dime more should the service count the spoken language on its own as well,
 * with the card's fee on top: a quarter covers it all. Browser-safe.
