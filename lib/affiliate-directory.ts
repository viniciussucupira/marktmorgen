/**
 * The affiliate directory (opened 11 October 2026): one page on
 * marktmorgen.com where people looking for something to promote find the
 * programs of the creators who said theirs may be listed
 * (lib/directory-index.ts keeps who said yes).
 *
 * What a row says is what an affiliate needs before applying, and nothing
 * that is not true of the program today: the store, the share of each sale,
 * how long after a click a sale still counts and which click wins, whether a
 * buyer stays theirs for later purchases, the day the creator pays and how
 * long a sale waits first, and the products that earn, each with what one
 * sale of it earns at today's price. Read from the store's own record, never
 * typed for the directory.
 *
 * And, only when the creator allows it too (a second box, apart from being
 * listed), the program's own numbers (lib/affiliates.ts, programNumbers):
 * its affiliates and since when, the clicks they brought and the sales those
 * clicks made, what they earned before refunds and what the creator recorded
 * as paid. A rate per click is shown only from MIN_CLICKS_FOR_RATES clicks.
 *
 * What it never says. No earnings an affiliate "can make", no ranking for
 * money, no score whose formula is kept from the people ranked by it: the
 * order is written on the page (DIRECTORY_ORDER), and nobody can pay to be
 * placed higher.
 *
 * Who is in it. A store whose creator said yes, whose program is on with a
 * share above 0, that can take a card today (lib/store-checkout.ts,
 * canSell), and that has at least one product an affiliate earns on. The
 * demo store never: it is a made-up store, and a made-up program in a list of
 * real ones would be a lie to every affiliate who applied to it.
 *
 * Money. Marktmorgen does not pay affiliates and never holds a sale: every
 * creator pays their own affiliates on the day they promise, as their program
 * page says. The directory says so too.
 *
 *   nl:dir:page   the rows, as JSON, kept 10 minutes; dropped whenever a
 *                 creator saves their program, so taking a store out is
 *                 immediate
