/**
 * The one-time count of what every store already keeps in the database
 * (added 18 October 2026), run before paid plans open.
 *
 * Each store's data room (lib/store-data.ts) counts what is written from the
 * day it was made: products, pages and posts as they are saved, what an
 * order leaves as it is written (lib/order-data.ts). What a store wrote
 * before that day sits outside the room until it is next written or moved,
 * so its room looks emptier than it is (docs/funded-exposure-review.md). This
 * job measures it once.
 *
 * It walks the whole database a page at a time and, for every key of a
 * family the room counts (lib/data-families.ts), finds the store it belongs
 * to by the ids in its name (or, for a link kept under a token, in its
 * value), and measures it the way an order's write is charged: its name and
 * ORDER_KEY_BYTES, each field, member or item with ORDER_ENTRY_BYTES (a
 * board's ORDER_BOARD_ENTRY_BYTES and its score), a quarter more, in steps.
 * Once every page is read, each store's room gets a slot, "legacy", set to
 * what was measured beyond what the room already counts: never less than
 * nothing, so the room ends at least as full as what was measured, and never
 * emptier than it was.
 *
 *   nl:recount:state   hash: phase (ids, scan, apply, done), cursor, version, started, finished
 *   nl:recount:ids     hash: an id a store's keys are named by -> the store; "*" when two share it
 *   nl:recount:sum     hash: a store -> what was measured of its keys
 *
 * Bounded per run (a deadline, and RECOUNT_PAGES pages of the database at the
 * most), so a large database is walked over several runs. Resumable: where a
 * run stopped is written with what it measured, in one script (RECOUNT_PAGE),
 * so a run that dies part way leaves nothing half-added and the next run
 * reads that page again. Idempotent: a store's slot is set, never added to,
 * so applying the same measure twice comes to the same room, and once done
 * the job does nothing until RECOUNT_VERSION changes.
 *
 * What it leaves out, said so: a key whose name and value carry no id of a
 * store (a mark under a payment's id, an address's library across stores) is
 * not anyone's room; those families are kept small by their own bounds
 * (tests/store-data-registry.ts). The job's own three keys are the
 * company's, and are deleted when it is done.
