/** Visit allowances, and where a month's visits stop.
 * A visitor count is not a bound on requests, transferred bytes, database
 * operations or CPU. These figures alone do not prove a funded cost ceiling
 * or the required 60% after-all-tax margin. Provider enforcement and the
 * commercial review must cover every resource at full simultaneous usage.
 *
 * Since 17 October 2026 visits past a plan's figure are never sold. A visit
 * was billed at VISIT_CENTS_PER_THOUSAND_OVER, half a cent for ten, against
 * about a fortieth of a cent of cost (tests/traffic-cost.ts): more than the
 * 17.2% of a price that a cost may be and still leave the owner's 60% after
 * a 27.5% tax. The price is not changed; it is no longer charged. Instead a
 * month's visits stop at the plan's figure, for every standing:
 *
 *   - the store's public pages (its page, products, blog, collections, the
 *     checkout script's cards) rest at publicVisitLimit, the figure less the
 *     share kept for buyers (BUYER_RESERVE_BPS);
 *   - what buyers already have (courses and lessons, the community and its
 *     live room, a private podcast's feed) goes on until the whole figure,
 *     then rests too, with a page that says their access is kept;
 *   - a checkout already open is never part of it: the checkout and the page
 *     after paying are not visits (lib/order-rules.ts stops new orders).

 * few minutes (made-up download links were enough) and shut its buyers out

 * that part of the window a day. It does not stop many machines at once: that
 * is the host's firewall's to stop, and the store's figure still bounds what
 * any number of them can cost.
 *
 * A connection's requests are added to its share SHARE_BATCH at a time, by
 * each server that answers them (lib/traffic.ts, overShare): one write, with
 * its expiry, for every SHARE_BATCH requests, so the share adds
 * SHARE_COMMANDS_PER_REQUEST to a request at the most, and one that asks less
