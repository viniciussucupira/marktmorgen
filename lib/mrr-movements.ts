/**
 * Monthly recurring revenue, month by month, split by what moved it (added 12
 * October 2026), as ChartMogul, Baremetrics and ProfitWell show it: new,
 * expansion, contraction, canceled and reactivated. And ARPU, ARR and net
 * revenue retention over twelve months.
 *
 * Counted per member (a Stripe customer), so a member who moves to a dearer
 * membership is expansion and not one leaving and one joining:
 *
 *   - new:          paying nothing at the start of the month, paying at its
 *                   end, and never paid before;
 *   - reactivated:  the same, for somebody who had paid before and left;
 *   - expansion and contraction: paying at both ends, more or less;
 *   - canceled:     paying at the start, nothing at the end.
 *
 * What each membership was worth at a moment comes from its invoices on the
 * creator's own Stripe account: each invoice line of a membership says the
 * price it was charged at from the start of its period, so a switch to
 * another plan shows from the day it was made. At list price, before
 * discounts and tax, as the MRR the page shows above; free trials are worth
 * nothing until they end; and "now" is the membership as Stripe holds it
 * today, so the last month ends on exactly the MRR above.
 *
 * Read with the page's other numbers (lib/membership-numbers.ts), in the same
 * ten-minute reading, never on a visit to the store.
