/**
 * The long description of a product: everything the 300 characters on the
 * store card cannot hold. What is inside, who it is for, what the buyer gets
 * and how.
 *
 * It is plain text, written the way people write in a message box: a blank
 * line starts a new paragraph, a line starting with "- " is a point in a
 * list, and an https address becomes a link. No markup is ever read from it,
 * so nothing a creator types — or pastes from somewhere else — can put a
 * script, a style or a hidden element on their page. The page builds every
 * element itself from the pieces below.
 *
 * It is kept in its own small record rather than inside the store's, because
 * the store's record is read on every visit to the store page and this text
 * is read only on the product's own page. Two hundred products with a long
 * description each would otherwise be carried by every visitor for nothing.
