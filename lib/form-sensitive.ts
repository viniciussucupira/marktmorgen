/**
 * 568 [GD2] (c): a creator's form never asks a visitor for what a scam asks for. A store's own forms collect
 * answers to the creator's questions; a password, a full card number, a card's security code or an identity
 * document's number are never among them (payment happens at Stripe's checkout, never in a form). Pure: it reads
 * the questions' own words, and flags; the studio refuses to save the form and names the field.
 *
 * Kept narrow on purpose: "gift card", "business card", a tax ID for an invoice, a postal "PIN code" or a
 * question about passwords are ordinary questions.
