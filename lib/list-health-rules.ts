/**
 * How far a store's list email is from its pause, and the words the email
 * screen explains in place (570 [DR1], unit 1; added 4 November 2026).
 *
 * Browser-safe: nothing here reads Redis, a setting or a secret. The lines are
 * the pause's own (lib/mail-health-rules.ts, the numbers lib/mail-health.ts
 * pauses on), compared the way overTheLine compares them. The state itself
 * ("fine", "watch", "near", "over"), its advice and its honest note are not
 * made again here: they are lib/mail-health-levels.ts (599 [KB20]), already
 * shown in the studio; roomLine is said beside its healthLine.
 *
 * Unit 2 (components/list-health-table.tsx): the same seven days as a table,
 * each count with its share, its level in words and how many more would
 * pause it (healthRows), and the words below explained in place.
 *
 * Next units of 570 [DR1]: the delivery report of each email to the list,
 * with each sender notice counted once where it is stored, and the 30-day
 * counts, which need storage beyond the 10 days (KEPT_SECONDS) the day counts
 * of lib/mail-health.ts are kept.
 *
 * Nothing here says an email reached the inbox or went to spam: no sender can
 * know that (TERMS.spamUnknown). There is no open count: no pixel is used.
