/**
 * Certificates of completion: a page that says a named person finished a
 * course, at an address anyone can open to check it.
 *
 * A student earns one when every lesson of the course is done and every quiz
 * that has to be passed is passed, on a course whose creator switched
 * certificates on. They type the name it should carry, and it carries that
 * name exactly as typed: nobody here knows how a person spells their own name
 * better than they do. The course title and the creator's name are written
 * into the certificate the moment it is issued, so renaming the course later
 * does not quietly change what was certified.
 *
 * The page at /@handle/certificate/<id> is the proof. It is served from the
 * record kept here, never from anything in the address, so a certificate
 * cannot be forged by editing a URL; and a creator who withdraws one — issued
 * to the wrong name, or to someone who was refunded — leaves the page saying
 * so, rather than making it vanish as if it had never been.
 *
 * One certificate per student per course. Withdrawing it lets the student
 * issue it again, under the name they type then.
 *
 *   nl:cert:<id>                  -> the certificate, as JSON, kept for good
 *   nl:course:<course>:certs      -> hash of student key -> standing certificate id
 *   nl:course:<course>:certs:all  -> set of every certificate id issued, withdrawn ones too
