/**
 * Pay per lead (added 18 October 2026; HighLevel audit H29): the terms a
 * creator sets for a fixed commission on each confirmed lead an affiliate
 * brings, and how each lead stands, worked out from what was recorded.
 *
 * Kept apart from lib/affiliate-leads.ts, which writes and reads the leads,
 * so the store record, the studio and the affiliate's page can know the terms
 * and a lead's status without importing anything that talks to Redis.
 *
 * What counts as a lead is the creator's choice, one of three, each confirmed
 * before it is recorded at all:
 *
 *   "signup"   an address that joined the creator's list by pressing the
 *              button in the email it was sent (double opt-in), and was not
 *              on the list before;
 *   "free"     a free product claimed from the emailed link, the first time
 *              that address got that product;
 *   "booking"  a call booked and paid for, which only counts once the call's
 *              time has passed, it was not refunded, and the creator says it
 *              took place.
 *
 * The money is the creator's, paid by the creator, exactly as a sale's
 * commission is (lib/affiliates.ts). What stops it being gamed:
 *
 *   - one lead per person per program: an address, written however it is
 *     written (lib/affiliates.ts canonicalEmail), is a lead once, ever;
 *   - nobody is their own lead, and the creator is nobody's;
 *   - confirmation first: nothing is recorded for an address that never
 *     pressed its emailed button, or a call that never happened;
 *   - velocity: only so many leads earn per affiliate per UTC day, and an
 *     hour holds a quarter of that; past them a lead is recorded and shown,
 *     and earns nothing;
 *   - a monthly budget for the whole program, which no lead passes;
 *   - a hold of at least MIN_LEAD_HOLD_DAYS, and then the creator's approval,
 *     before a lead can be paid; the creator can reverse any lead as not
 *     genuine, and the affiliate sees that, with the reason (one already paid
 *     then comes off what is owed, as a refunded sale does).
 *
 * Each lead is judged by the terms in force when it was confirmed (its own
 * amount, hold, daily cap and the month's budget then), so changing them later
 * rewrites nobody's lead, as changing a share never reaches back into a sale.
