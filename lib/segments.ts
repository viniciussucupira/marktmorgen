/**
 * Saved groups of a store's list, and three ways to narrow an email by money
 * (added 12 October 2026).
 *
 * Until now an email could go to everybody, to the buyers or the people who
 * have not bought, to those who got one product, leaving out those who got
 * another. Kissmetrics' Populations, Segment's audiences and the cohorts of
 * Amplitude and Mixpanel add what a store knows and a list does not: how much
 * somebody has spent, where they first found the store, and how long it has
 * been since they last bought. Those three are what turn "everyone who
 * bought" into the letter for the best customers, or for the ones who went
 * quiet.
 *
 * None of the three is written down about anybody. Each is worked out from
 * the store's own sales on the creator's Stripe account (lib/stats.ts,
 * readPaidSales), only when an email asks for one, and the answer is kept ten
 * minutes so a creator changing the boxes does not ask Stripe each time:
 *
 *   nl:stats:<statsId>:ledger   JSON { c: currency, p: partial, v: 4, r: [[address, cents, last ms, channel, orders], …] }, ten minutes
 *   nl:mail:segs:<listId>       hash: <id> → JSON Segment, the store's saved groups
 *
 * A group is a name over the choices the composer already has: who, one
 * product, one left out, and the three above. Choosing it fills them in.
