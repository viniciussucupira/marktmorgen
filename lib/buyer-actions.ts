/**
 * What buyers do inside what they bought, counted in the store's month
 * (added 18 October 2026, when tests/plan-cost-registry.ts still listed
 * them as OPEN: bounded per person, never per store).
 *
 * Two kinds of request, each taken before anything else is read or written:
 *
 *   an action      a community post, comment, edit, like, vote, report,
 *                  RSVP, message, live-room message, picture door or phone
 *                  sign-up; a lesson comment, a hand-in and its upload door,
 *                  a lesson marked done, a certificate made. One of the
 *                  store's "buyer" figure (lib/store-allowance-rules.ts). The
 *                  creator acting in their own community or lessons takes
 *                  one of their studio requests instead.
 *   a read         a community picture, an event's calendar file, a
 *                  lesson's download, a sign-in link asked for or opened, a
 *                  podcast episode: one of the store's public requests on the
 *                  buyers' side (lib/traffic.ts, takePublicRequest), several
 *                  for a picture, whose bytes pass through us.
 *
 * Deleting what one wrote is never counted: it can only follow an action
 * that was, and the action's unit is priced to cover both.
 *
 * Past the figure, a buyer is sent to the page that says the store is
 * resting for now (app/[handle]/resting), or told so in the answer; what
 * they already have is kept, and nobody is ever stopped while paying.
