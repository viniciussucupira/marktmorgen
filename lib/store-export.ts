/**
 * Everything a store keeps, as one file its owner can take anywhere (added
 * 18 October 2026), offered in the studio and in every notice before a
 * store closes (lib/plan-closing.ts): its products and their prices, pages,
 * long descriptions and notes after paying; its blog posts; its courses with
 * every lesson's text; its forms with their answers; its contacts; and a
 * summary of its orders, read from its own Stripe account and its PayPal
 * records. Files, videos and community posts are not in it: files and videos
 * are downloaded from the studio one by one, and a community's posts are its
 * members' as much as the creator's.
 *
 * Written out as it is read, a part at a time, so a large store is never
 * held whole in memory. What it reads is the store's data room and its
 * sales on its Stripe account, so what it costs is counted the way the room
 * is, with the wait for Stripe's pages: while a plan runs it is taken from
 * the store's studio figure at exportUnits of its size
 * (tests/closing-cost.test.ts holds the units to the cost), and once a plan
 * has ended it is taken the same way from the studio figure a store whose
 * plan ended keeps to take its data away (lib/store-allowance-rules.ts,
 * NON_PAYING_ALLOWANCES.ended), in the share of stores that pay nothing:
 * that figure holds the export of the largest store there can be
 * (tests/closing-cost.test.ts).
