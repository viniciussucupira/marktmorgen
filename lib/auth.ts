/**
 * Signing a creator in, without a password.
 *
 * The creator types their email and we send a link. Clicking it signs them in.
 * There is no password to invent, none to forget, and no table of other
 * people's passwords for us to guard — which is the kind of thing a one-person
 * company should not be guarding.
 *
 * Two short-lived records do the work, both in Redis, both keyed by a one-way
 * hash so the raw token and the raw session id never rest anywhere:
 *
 *   nl:auth:link:<hash>     -> email, 15 minutes, deleted the moment it is used
 *                              (and, under its own salt, a login with Google
 *                              on its way, 10 minutes, lib/google-signin.ts)
 *   nl:auth:session:<hash>  -> email, 30 days, deleted on sign-out
 *   nl:auth:fresh:<hash>    -> that the session was opened in the last 15
 *                              minutes, for the few changes that ask for a
 *                              recent login (adding a passkey)
 *   nl:auth:second:<hash>   -> the second step this session was opened with
 *                              ("app", "recovery" or "passkey:<its id>"), as long as
 *                              the session; none for an emailed link, Google,
 *                              a recovery address or a move (sessionSecondStep)
 *   nl:auth:sessions:<hash> -> the set of a creator's live sessions, so that
 *                              they can close every one of them at once
 *   nl:auth:move:<hash>     -> a move from one address to another, 15 minutes,
 *                              spent on the tap that finishes it
 *   nl:auth:devices:<hash>  -> the browsers an account has signed in from,
 *                              each by a one-way hash of its nl_device cookie
 *   nl:auth:code:<hash>     -> the six-digit code sent with a link (652 [WG12]),
 *                              by the request that asked for it: a hash of the
 *                              code, the link it spends, the tries; 15 minutes
 *   nl:auth:linkcode:<hash> -> from a link to its code, so either spends both
 *   nl:auth:lastcode:<hash> -> an address's newest code: only that one opens
 *   nl:rl:code-addr:<hash>  -> the code tries for one address in the hour, all
 *                              its requests together
 *   nl:rl:code-day:<hash>   -> the same, for a day from the first try
 *   nl:rl:code-ip:<hash>    -> the code tries from one machine in the hour
 *
 * A passkey (lib/passkeys.ts) opens exactly the same kind of session, so
 * everything here — "log out of all devices" included — covers it too.
 *
 * Signing in from a browser the account has not signed in from before sends
 * the creator a plain email saying so, with when and how, and what to do if
 * it was not them. The browser is recognised by a random id in a long-lived
 * cookie of its own; clearing cookies, or a private window, looks like a new
 * browser, which errs on the side of telling. The very first sign-in of an
 * account, and the first after this began, is only written down: the person
 * has just opened the email that let them in.
 *
 * Two counters keep the sending honest: one for the machine that asks, one for
 * the address that would receive. The second one matters because the first one
 * cannot see a flood that arrives from many machines at once.
