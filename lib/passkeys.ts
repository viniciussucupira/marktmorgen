/**
 * Passkeys: logging in with the phone or laptop the creator already unlocks.
 *
 * Optional, and never instead of the emailed link: an account with a passkey
 * still logs in by email whenever it wants to, so losing a phone never locks
 * anyone out. A passkey is added from the studio while logged in, and used on
 * /signin with one tap, without typing an address — the browser offers the
 * passkeys it holds for this site (WebAuthn, through @simplewebauthn).
 *
 * What we keep is the public half of each key and a counter; the private
 * half never leaves the creator's device, so there is nothing here that
 * would let anyone log in if it leaked. The key is bound to marktmorgen.com,
 * where the studio lives; a store on a creator's own domain never logs a
 * creator in. Every sign-in with a passkey needs the device's own check — a
 * fingerprint, a face, a PIN — not only its presence.
 *
 *   nl:pk:<hash>             the account's passkeys, as JSON (ten at most)
 *   nl:pk:cred:<hash>        which account a passkey belongs to, by its id
 *   nl:pk:reg:<hash>         the challenge for a passkey being added, 5 minutes,
 *                            tied to the session adding it
 *   nl:pk:auth:<hash>        the challenge for a sign-in, 5 minutes, tied to a
 *                            cookie of that browser; spent by the answer
 *   nl:pk:drop:<hash>        passkeys a session without a second step asked to
 *                            remove, and the day they go (REMOVAL_DAYS later);
 *                            no expiry until applied; only "Keep it" from a
 *                            session with a valid second step calls it off
 *   nl:pk:lock:<hash>        the account's lock while its passkeys change, seconds
 *
 * A session opened with a passkey is the same session an emailed link opens
 * (lib/auth.ts), so "Log out of all devices" closes it like any other.
