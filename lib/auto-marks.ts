/**
 * Marks the numbers put on their own chart (added 12 October 2026): the days
 * an email went to the list, a product was added and a store sale began or
 * ended, so a rise or a fall is explained without anyone having had to note
 * it down. Beside the notes a creator types (lib/stats-notes.ts).
 *
 * Read before it was built: Fathom's Chart Milestones, DataFast's notes made
 * from GitHub commits, Plausible's and Pirsch's annotations. Each mark here
 * comes from something the store itself recorded — an email's send time, a
 * product's creation, a sale's dates — so nothing on the chart is guessed.
 * Days are UTC, like every day of the numbers.
