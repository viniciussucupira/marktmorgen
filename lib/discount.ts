/**
 * Discount codes, kept on the creator's own Stripe account.
 *
 * A code here is two Stripe objects on the creator's connected account: a
 * Coupon, which is the discount itself, and a Promotion Code, which is the
 * word a buyer types. Both belong to the creator. That is not an incidental
 * choice — it means the redemption count is Stripe's count, the expiry is
 * Stripe's expiry, and a creator who leaves takes their codes with them. We
 * are not holding a second ledger of who got what off.
 *
 * It also means we never compute a discounted price ourselves. The buyer types
 * the code inside Stripe Checkout, Stripe decides whether it is live and what
 * it takes off, and the amount charged is Stripe's arithmetic on a coupon the
 * creator made. A platform that worked out the discount itself would be a
 * platform that can get somebody's money wrong.
 *
 * On Stan this is behind their $99 plan, checked on their own pricing page on
 * 20 September 2026. Here it is in the one price.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * A note on the API version, because it is the sharp edge in this file.
 *
 * Stripe moved the Promotion Code's `coupon` parameter into a `promotion` hash
 * in version 2025-09-30.clover. Which of the two shapes is accepted depends on
 * the version the request runs at, and left unset that is whatever our platform
 * account happens to default to — which somebody could change in a dashboard
 * next year and break every code created here. So every call below pins the
 * version explicitly. The request and the version can then never disagree.
