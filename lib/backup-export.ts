/**
 * 273 [BK1]: the export of every key of ours in the database, for the daily
 * backup, and its restore into an empty database. Built and tested; nothing
 * calls it yet (no schedule, bucket, credential or key exists: those are the
 * owner's steps in docs/backup.md), so it is off.
 *
 * The export walks the keys with SCAN, keeps those under BACKUP_PREFIX, and
 * copies each with DUMP (Redis's own serialized value, every type, read with
 * the REST API's base64 answers so its bytes are not lost) and PEXPIRETIME
 * (the moment it ends, as the server has it). What it costs is counted as it
 * goes: each SCAN is checked against the budget before it is sent, and the
 * whole copy (two commands a key) before any DUMP is. SCAN with MATCH walks
 * the whole database, other products' keys too, so its pages grow with every
 * key there, not only ours. The copy's size is held to `maxBytes` (at most
 * what the backup format seals) batch by batch, and no batch is sent once it
 * is reached. A cap reached is a refusal of the whole: never a partial copy
 * handed back as if it were the whole database. Upstash bills every command
 * (https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/billing, read 31 October 2026).
 *
 * Not a point-in-time copy: a key written while the walk runs may be in it
 * with its newer value, and one made after its part of the walk is not; a
 * key's value and its end are read in one request but not as one step. A key
 * gone between the walk and its DUMP is left out, never copied empty.
 *
 * The restore writes into a database that has none of the keys: it looks
 * first and refuses before writing anything when one is there; a key made
 * after that look is refused by the server itself (RESTORE without REPLACE),
 * which stops the restore there.
