/**
 * Deletions that answer what they deleted, in one step (added 4 November
 * 2026, for lib/person-erasure.ts).
 *
 * A deletion that gives room back to a store's data room (lib/store-data.ts)
 * has to give back what it removed, and only once. Reading a record and then
 * deleting it in a second command lets two deletions at the same moment both
 * read it and both give its room back; each script below reads and deletes
 * inside Redis, so the second one finds nothing and gives nothing.
 * lib/redis-memory.ts runs the same scripts for the tests.
