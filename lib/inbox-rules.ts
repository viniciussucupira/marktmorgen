/**
 * The store's inbox (added 13 October 2026): ClickFunnels' MessageHub, for
 * what a creator's buyers and visitors actually write. One place in the
 * studio for:
 *
 *   - a chat on the store's pages, switched on by the creator: a visitor
 *     writes with their address, and sees the answer there while the page is
 *     open, or by email when they have gone;
 *   - the store's contact form, which also still goes to the creator's own
 *     inbox as before.
 *
 * In the studio: the conversations, open ones first; an answer written there
 * goes to the visitor's chat and their email; saved replies to put in with
 * one press; a conversation given to one person of the team; closed when it
 * is done; and, where the writing help is on, a suggested answer written
 * from the conversation and the store's own FAQ, for the creator to change
 * before it is sent (one of the month's AI jobs).
 *
 * What it never does: write to anybody but the person who wrote first, and
 * only in answer to them; send a visitor's address or name to the writing
 * help (addresses, phone numbers and links are taken out first); keep a
 * conversation past KEEP_DAYS after its last message.
 *
 * Pure and browser-safe: the store's widget, the studio and the server read
 * these rules.
