/**
 * A store closing fairly for the people who bought from it (queue item 307
 * [EC1], owner's request of 23 October 2026, 15h58 Fortaleza, and its
 * complement of 30 October 2026, 13h12 Fortaleza). The figures and the words;
 * the server side is lib/closing-holds.ts, lib/closing-buyers.ts and
 * lib/closing-refunds.ts. Browser-safe: the studio and the checkout read these
 * too.
 *
 * What it changes, against what lib/plan-closing.ts did before:
 *
 *   1. Before buying, every buyer of something that lasts (a course, a
 *      download, a private podcast, a community, a membership) reads one
 *      fixed sentence, drawn here and never by the creator: access comes from
 *      the store on Marktmorgen, and if the store closes we email its buyers
 *      at least BUYER_NOTICE_DAYS days first, up to the closing's cap
 *      (buyerNoticeCap), which the Terms state.
 *   2. On the day a plan ends, not on the closing day, no member is charged
 *      again until the closing: Stripe's own pause of collection with its
 *      invoices voided, on the creator's account (lib/closing-holds.ts). The
 *      members keep their access. A plan started again before the closing
 *      resumes each one exactly as it was, with nothing charged for the days
 *      in between.
 *   3. On the closing day every membership and payment plan ends at once,
 *      not at the end of its period.
 *   4. Time members paid for past the closing day is shown to the creator
 *      (UNUSED, below), with a button that gives it back from the creator's
 *      own Stripe account; whatever is left on the closing day is given back
 *      by the code that day, the same amounts, once. A balance that does not
 *      cover it is never made up by Marktmorgen: the member is told, with the
 *      creator's contact.
 *   5. BUYER_NOTICE_DAYS days before the closing every buyer gets one
 *      service email from Marktmorgen; if the plan is started again after
 *      it, one short email says the store stays.
 *   6. The creator's notices and studio say all of that, with the dates.
