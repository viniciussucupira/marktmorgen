/**
 * Pictures a function answers, paced (18 October 2026,
 * docs/security-audit-2026-10-18.md, MM-SA-04).
 *
 * A product picture (app/api/image), a store photo (app/api/photo) and a
 * store's home-screen icon (app/[handle]/app-icon) are costed as requests the
 * CDN answers (tests/traffic-cost.ts): their addresses never change what is
 * behind them, so they are kept for a year and almost never reach a function.
 * Nothing held that true for an address the CDN had not seen. The CDN keeps
 * an answer per address, query string included, so `?1`, `?2`, `?3` on one
 * picture were each read again from the file store (up to a megabyte) or the
 * database (up to 200 KB), and a made-up name was a function and a read each
 * time: no store's figure counted any of it, so a loop from one machine was a
 * bill with no ceiling.
 *
 * Now:
 *   - an address with anything after its path is sent, with no read, to the
 *     one address the CDN keeps (`canonicalPicture`); the icon, whose one
 *     query is its fingerprint, is sent to its current one before it is drawn;
 *   - every answer a function gives, the read or the "not found", is paced in
 *     this server's memory (lib/local-limit.ts), by connection and by file,
 *     which costs no store command. A visitor's browser asks the CDN, not us;
 *     a first visitor in a region, who does reach us, asks for a page's worth
 *     of pictures, far inside either pace.
