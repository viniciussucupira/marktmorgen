/**
 * "Where did you hear about us?" (added 11 October 2026): one question on the
 * page a buyer lands on after paying, answered with a tap or not at all.
 *
 * What it is for. Every count in the studio sees a click: a link, a site, an
 * app. None of them sees a friend who said "you should buy this", a voice
 * note, a podcast, a group chat — what marketers call dark social, and for a
 * creator often the biggest channel there is. The only way to know is to ask
 * the buyer, which is what Hotjar's and PostHog's surveys are bought for. So
 * the store asks, once, after the money has been paid and nothing depends on
 * the answer.
 *
 * What is kept: a count of each answer, and the money of the sales it was
 * given for, on the day's record of the store's numbers — not the buyer, not
 * the order, not the time. The order is looked up once, to check it is a
 * paid order of this store, and marked answered so it is counted once.
 *
 * A creator who would rather not ask switches it off; it is on otherwise,
 * because it costs the buyer one tap they can skip.
 *
 *   nl:heard:off              set of store handles that do not ask
 *   nl:heard:done:<session>   an order whose answer was counted (30 days)
 *   day record h:<answer>     answers; hc:<answer> the money of their sales
