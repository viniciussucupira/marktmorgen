/**
 * What a store's plan refund would be today, read from our own Stripe
 * account (305 [SY1] unit 1). Read-only: it asks Stripe and answers with the
 * amount the rules in lib/plan-refund-rules.ts give, and which payment it is
 * for. It writes nothing anywhere, and nothing calls it yet; the button, its
 * review page and the refund itself come in the next units.
 *
 * Which payment is looked at (app/refunds/page.tsx, sections 2, 3 and 5):
 *   - the guarantee is for "the first charge we make to you, on any plan,
 *     monthly or yearly, for any of your stores", once per person. So the
 *     first payment is the oldest succeeded charge of this store's customer,
 *     and only when no earlier succeeded charge exists for the same person:
 *     another of our customers with the same email address (the store's or
 *     the customer's), or the same card (Stripe's card fingerprint). It is
 *     this store's only when it paid one of this store's plan invoices;
 *   - otherwise the store's latest paid plan invoice, for a yearly plan's
 *     months not started (a monthly renewal gives nothing).
 *
 * Never a silent no: whatever cannot be read or decided whole (a list longer
 * than one page, more same-address customers than MAX_OTHER_CUSTOMERS, a
 * failed request, the time or request budget spent) answers "unknown", for
 * the page to send the creator to support instead of showing a button that
 * would fail or hiding one the policy promises.
 *
 * Bounded: at most MAX_CALLS requests to Stripe and READ_BUDGET_MS in all.
 * Stripe's search can lag "under 1 minute" behind a new charge
 * (docs.stripe.com/search, "Data freshness", read 31/10/2026); it is used
 * only for charges older than the one being judged. Query fields read on the
 * same page: customers by `email`, charges by
 * `payment_method_details.card.fingerprint`, `status` and `created`.
 * Lists read: GET /v1/charges (customer, newest first, limit up to 100,
 * docs.stripe.com/api/charges/list), GET /v1/disputes (charge,
 * docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/list), both read 31/10/2026; GET
 * /v1/invoices by subscription and status as lib/closing-plan-guard.ts does.
 * Every read is at API version AT, where an invoice names its `charge` and
 * `tax` and a charge names its `invoice`.
