/**
 * The people who help run a store, and what they did.
 *
 * The owner invites someone by email with a role (lib/team-roles.ts). The
 * email carries a link that works once and for seven days; the person taps
 * it, which proves the inbox is theirs, and from then on they sign in the
 * way everyone here does — an emailed link or a passkey — and find the store
 * in their studio. There is no password anywhere in this, and no account to
 * make first.
 *
 *   nl:team:<store id>        -> { members, invites }, as JSON
 *   nl:team:invite:<hash>     -> the store, the invite and the address it is
 *                                for; seven days, spent by the tap that uses it
 *   nl:team:of:<hash>         -> the ids of the stores a person is on (a set);
 *                                a hint for their studio, never the proof —
 *                                the store's own record is read every time
 *   nl:team:log:<store id>    -> what the team did, newest first, 500 lines
 *
 * Membership is read from the store's record on every request that uses it,
 * so taking someone out, or changing their role, counts from their very next
 * click, whatever sessions they have open.
 *
 * Five people at most per store, invitations still waiting included. The
 * owner is told by email when someone joins and when a role changes
 * (lib/account-notice.ts), because a new pair of hands on a store is exactly
 * what a stolen session would add.
 *
 * Every change to a team is made with the team's lock held (lib/redis-lock
 * .ts), so two changes at the same instant — someone joining while the owner
 * takes somebody else off — are made one after the other. Without it the
 * second would write back the team it read before the first, and a person
 * just taken off could be back on it.
