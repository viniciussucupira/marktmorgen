/**
 * A lesson's quiz drafted with AI (added 10 October 2026): the rules, which
 * the studio's browser reads too. The part that asks the model is in
 * lib/ai.ts (writeQuiz); the quiz itself is lib/quiz.ts.
 *
 * Measured before it was built: Thinkific and Kajabi draft quiz questions
 * from a lesson; Stan has no quizzes at all. Here a creator presses one
 * button under a lesson and gets questions to read, change and save, or not.
 *
 * What makes a drafted quiz worth saving rather than a chore to fix:
 *
 *   - It is drawn from the lesson only: its text, and what the creator types
 *     about it. A question the lesson does not answer is unfair to a student.
 *   - The right answer is not where a student would guess it. The model is
 *     told to keep every answer the same length, and the order is shuffled
 *     here, so the right one moves around and is never in the same place
 *     two questions in a row.
 *   - Nothing is saved. The questions land in the editor beside any the
 *     creator already has, and Save the quiz is still theirs to press.
