/**
 * Where proposals and agreements are kept (lib/agreement-rules.ts says what
 * one is), and where a signature is written.
 *
 *   nl:agree:r:<id>              the agreement: who it is for, each version's fingerprint and signature, for KEEP_DAYS from the day it was made
 *   nl:agree:v:<id>:<n>          version n's exact text, lines and fingerprint: written once (SET NX), never changed, kept as long as the agreement
 *   nl:agree:s:<sid>             the store's agreements: id -> when made
 *   nl:agree:p:<sid>:<person>    one person's agreements in the store (lib/person-key.ts), for the cap and for deleting them
 *   nl:agree:lock:<id>           a signature or a new version being written, ten seconds
 *
 * Every byte is counted in the store's data room before it is written
 * (lib/store-data.ts): the record with room for its five signatures when it
 * is made, and each version when it is made, until the day it goes by itself.
 *
 * A signature and a new version take the same lock and read the record
 * again under it, so a signature can only ever land on the version the
 * signer read (its number and fingerprint must still be the latest), and an
 * edit made while someone is signing becomes a new version that needs its
 * own signature. Every other change to the record (what the emails about it
 * write down) is made under the same lock on the record as it is then
 * (changeAgreement), never on one read before an email went: written back
 * as it had been read, it took off a signature or a version given while the
 * email was on its way (docs/security-audit-2026-10-18.md, MM-SA-03). The
 * lock is let go of only by whoever holds it (lib/redis-lock.ts).
