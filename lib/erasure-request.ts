/**
 * A person deleting themselves from a store, or from every store, without
 * asking anybody (added 17 October 2026). The page is /privacy/delete.
 *
 * They type their address, and the store's name when they came from one. If
 * that address is known there — on its list, as a buyer, or as having joined
 * it — a link is emailed to it; the page says the same whether or not it is,
 * so the form cannot be used to learn who buys from whom, and nothing is
 * sent to an address the stores do not know. The link works for an hour and
 * opens a page that says what will be deleted and what is kept; pressing
 * the button there deletes them (lib/person-erasure.ts), and each store's
 * owner is told it was done. Nobody is asked to approve it.
 *
 * Every store is the stores the address bought from or joined itself, as
 * lib/buyer-library.ts notes them: a store whose list an import alone put
 * them on is found when they ask from that store.
 *
 * Bounded like the library's link: a few asks an hour from one network
 * address and for one email address, one email per ask (taken from the
 * first store's figure for such emails), and each store's own erasure
 * counted against that store's studio figure (lib/person-erasure.ts).
 *
 *   nl:erase:link:<hash of a token>  { e: address, s: [store ids still to do] }, an hour
