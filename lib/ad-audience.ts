/**
 * The store's buyers as a file the ad platforms take (added 11 October 2026):
 * Meta's customer list and TikTok's customer file both read a column of email
 * addresses named "email".
 *
 * What it is for. Two things that make ads cheaper: leaving out the people
 * who already bought, so the creator stops paying to show them the thing
 * they own; and asking the platform for more people like those who bought (a
 * lookalike audience), which is how ad platforms find buyers fastest. Cometly
 * and Polar sell sending audiences to ad platforms; here it is a file the
 * creator uploads themselves, so nothing of theirs is connected to anybody.
 *
 * Who is in it: only buyers on the creator's list who agreed to hear from the
 * creator and have not left it (lib/contacts.ts, mailable) — never somebody
 * who bought without ticking the box, unsubscribed, or whose address
 * bounced. The address and nothing else: no name, no product, no amount.
 * Using it is the creator's to answer for, as the terms say: the platforms
 * require that they have their customers' permission, and in some places
 * that means asking for it in so many words.
