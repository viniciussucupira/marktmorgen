/**
 * Pictures let in through the picture door (app/api/store/image/upload) and
 * not put on anything yet.
 *
 * A picture's name is chosen by the browser and the routes that put one on a
 * product, a link or a page only check that it sits in the store's own picture
 * folder. That folder is shared by every picture of the store, so a name the
 * browser sends may be the picture of another product, link or page. When
 * putting one on fails, the file may be deleted only when this very request
 * took it from this list and the file was stored after the door wrote it down
 * (dropTakenPictures): the door notes each name it signs for, only while no
 * file has that name, and the first route that tries to put it on anything
 * takes it off, whether that succeeds or not. A picture already on something
 * was taken then (or signed before this list existed, and never written
 * down), so a failed request naming it deletes nothing. Unknown is kept: a
 * file left behind costs storage, a picture deleted from under a product
 * costs the creator's page.
 *
 * The same note is what lets a new name onto a record at all (4 November
 * 2026, after a review proved that a picture put on a second record was
 * deleted with it): a product's or a link's picture, and a page's new one,
 * must be taken from this list by the request that puts it on, or be that
 * record's own already. A name another record shows, a buyer's review photo
 * or an email's picture was never noted (or was taken when it was put on),
 * so it is refused there, and taking it off the second record later can
 * never delete it. A picture put on before this rule stays where it is shown
 * and can still be kept or replaced there.
 *
 * One list per store's picture folder, so one store's doors never push out
 * another's. Notes older than PICTURE_DOOR_SECONDS, and past the newest
 * PICTURE_DOOR_MAX of the store, are dropped as new ones come in, and the list
 * itself expires a window after its last note; a dropped or stale note is
 * never taken, so its file is never deleted by a failure (it costs storage, at
 * most MAX_IMAGE_BYTES in lib/product-image.ts), never deleted wrongly.
