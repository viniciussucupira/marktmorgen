/**
 * Deleting one person from one store, everywhere the store keeps them
 * (added 17 October 2026; ClickFunnels audit F64 and F28).
 *
 * Two doors lead here, and both do the same thing: a creator, or a teammate
 * whose role may delete people (lib/team-roles.ts, "erase"), presses
 * "Delete this person" on the buyer's page in the studio; or the person
 * proves their address by an emailed link and asks for it themselves
 * (lib/erasure-request.ts). Nobody is asked to do anything by hand.
 *
 * In order:
 *
 *   1. A one-way fingerprint of the address goes on the store's list of the
 *      deleted (lib/suppression.ts) before anything is taken away, so even
 *      an erasure cut short half-way never lets them be emailed again.
 *   2. Every module that keeps something about a person of a store forgets
 *      it, through the function it exports for that (lib/person-data.ts
 *      names each one, and tests/person-data-registry.test.ts fails when a
 *      module keeps something per person and is not there).
 *   3. The files they handed in and the photos on their reviews are deleted
 *      from the file store, or, when it does not answer, by the daily job
 *      that deletes uploads nobody kept, within a day.
 *   4. From the studio, the store's activity log notes that a person was
 *      deleted, by whom and how many records went, never the address; a
 *      person's own deletion is told to the store's owner by email instead.
 *
 * What is kept, and why, is the registry's "kept" entries: the payments on
 * the creator's own Stripe account, which are the creator's sales and tax
 * records and never stored here, and the few order records of ours a sale
 * or a refund still needs (lib/person-data.ts says which, field by field).
 *
 * Each step can be run again: an erasure that stopped half-way (a database
 * that did not answer) is finished by pressing again, and an erasure of
 * somebody already gone deletes nothing more.
 *
 * What it costs is counted before it is incurred, from the store's studio
 * figure (lib/store-allowance-rules.ts), whichever door it came through: the
 * part its record says (products, courses) before anything is read, the rest
 * once the courses are read and a few counts taken (lib/erasure-rules.ts,
 * erasureUnits), sized in tests/person-erasure.test.ts to cover what it sends.
