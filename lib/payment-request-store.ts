 *
 *   nl:payreq:r:<id>               the request, as JSON, for KEEP_DAYS from the day it was made
 *   nl:payreq:s:<sid>              the store's requests: id -> when made
 *   nl:payreq:o:<sid>              the store's open requests: id -> when its link stops taking payment
 *   nl:payreq:p:<sid>:<person>     one person's requests in the store (lib/person-key.ts), for the cap and for deleting them
 *   nl:payreq:due                  reminders waiting: "<sid>|<id>" -> when due, read by the daily job
 *   nl:payreq:stores               stores with open requests, read by the five-minute job (lib/checkout-sweep.ts)
 *   nl:payreq:lock:<id>            a checkout being opened for it, a minute
 *   nl:payreq:w:<id>               its record being changed, ten seconds at the most
 *
 * Every request is counted in the store's data room before it is written
 * (lib/store-data.ts), at its record, its four index entries and what its
 * record can still grow by (RECORD_GROWTH_BYTES), in the month it expires
 * by itself. The counts (open, kept, per person) are taken the way a store
 * figure is: added, read back, and given back when over, so two at once can
 * never both pass a full count.
 *
 * Every change to a record is read again and written under its own lock
 * (changeRequest), so one hand never writes back what it read before another
 * hand's change: a reminder that was still being emailed, or a checkout still
 * being opened at Stripe, could otherwise put a paid request back to open
 * (docs/security-audit-2026-10-18.md, MM-SA-02).
 *
 * Nothing here is the record of a payment: that is the checkout and the
 * charge on the creator's own Stripe account, read by every door that asks
 * (lib/refunds.ts). What is kept here is what the creator asked for and
 * what became of it, so the studio can say it and the buyer's page can show it.
