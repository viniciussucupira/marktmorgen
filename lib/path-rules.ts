/**
 * Marktmorgen Path, as rules (added 18 October 2026; docs/marktmorgen-path.md
 * has the inventory of what a store already records and every decision).
 *
 * A path of missions that takes a creator from a published store to the
 * first real sale, with levels after it. Three rules hold everything here:
 *
 *   - Every mission ends on a fact the store already records, never on a
 *     box somebody ticks: a title and a line on the public page, a product
 *     with what the buyer gets, a test purchase Stripe marks as test mode, a
 *     visit counted from a social network, short links made for posts, an
 *     address left on the store, a paid order Stripe confirms. `PathFacts`
 *     is the only input; nothing in this file can mark a mission done.
 *   - Nothing here is a forecast. The income goal is the person's own figure
 *     and is only ever shown as "your goal"; no sentence projects, promises
 *     or compares earnings.
 *   - Nothing here fails. A day not done is the day to do next; there is no
 *     "missed", no "behind", no screen that says a person fell short.
 *
 * Pure, so the studio page, the reminder job and the tests read it the same
 * way, and a browser can import it.
