 *
 * The default describes the published offer, not fee-collection readiness.
 * Pass false for a historical subscription-only account. Publishing an offer
 * never enables collection; platform-share.ts still checks COMMISSION_LIVE.
 * They live here so that the published menu changes every one of them at once. A

 * after the switch, which is a price advertised that the checkout does not

 * after the switch is held to never saying it either.
