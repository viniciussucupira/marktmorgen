/**
 * Who is given what in a creator's Discord server (lib/discord-rules.ts).
 *
 * Joining: a buyer agreed on Discord's page; which of the store's products
 * that give roles their address holds is read from the creator's Stripe
 * account (lib/community-access.ts), and they are put in the server with
 * those roles. One Discord account per address: bringing in another moves
 * the roles to it, so a purchase cannot open the server for a friend too.
 *
 * Checking: everyone given roles is checked again every CHECK_HOURS, by the
 * job (app/api/cron/discord). Roles for products no longer held are taken
 * back, roles a product gives since are added, and somebody who holds none
 * any more loses every role given and, when the creator asked for it, is
 * taken out of the server. Only roles this store gave are ever taken: a
 * role the creator gave by hand stays. When Stripe or Discord cannot be
 * asked, nothing is taken and the person is checked again later.
