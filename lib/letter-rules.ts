/**
 * Emails published on the store (Kajabi's "newsletters, by email and on the
 * web"; docs/zero-cost-value-2026-10-18.md, item 1; added 18 October 2026):
 * the rules, browser-safe.
 *
 * A creator may publish an email they already sent to their list as a page
 * of their store, at /@handle/letters/<id>, with a page listing every one
 * published. Only on purpose, one email at a time, and never by itself:
 * an email sent to some buyers only may hold what those buyers paid for, so
 * nothing is published that the creator did not choose, and the studio says
 * that anyone can read it once it is.
 *
 * What is published is a copy of the email's subject and words as they were
 * sent, written once when it is published: its links as the creator typed
 * them (not the tagged ones each reader's email carried), and nothing about
 * who received it. Taking it off deletes the copy.
 *
 * No new cost: the copy and its place in the list are counted in the store's
 * data room before they are written, and each page view is one of the
 * store's public requests, as every store page is.
 *
 * For members only (queue items 28 [E11] and 100 [E2-MEMBER-PUBLICATIONS],
 * added 4 November 2026): the creator may check, when publishing, the
 * products that open it. Then its subject and who it is for are shown to
 * everyone, and its words only to somebody who proved their address and
 * holds one of those products now (lib/letter-access.ts, the same answer a
 * community's door gives). Nothing checked: everyone can read it, as before.
 *
 * With a preview (queue item 428 [BV1], added 6 November 2026): an email kept
 * for members may show everyone its first one to LETTER_PREVIEW_MAX parts
 * (the blocks lib/mail-body.ts reads, split at blank lines), so a visitor
 * sees what the products open. Never its last part: a preview can never show
 * the whole email. A stored preview that is not a whole number in range, or
 * on an email open to all, shows none: less, never more.
