/**
 * One product bought for several people, kept and handed out (the rules, and
 * why it exists, are in lib/group-rules.ts).
 *
 *   nl:grp:<id>              string  the purchase: store, product, how many people; once paid, its payment
 *   nl:grp:<id>:m            hash    address hash -> { e, at }: who took a place; its length is how many are taken
 *   nl:grp:<id>:n            string  how many places were taken, as counted before 5 November 2026 (no longer written)
 *   nl:grp:<id>:t:<hash>     string  one open of an address's link at a time, for 30 seconds at most
 *   nl:grp:<id>:mail         string  emails this link sent today, so it cannot be used to fill inboxes
 *   nl:grp:take:<token>      string  the link in a place's email: which purchase, which address
 *   nl:grp:pi:<payment>      string  the purchase a payment paid for, so a refund finds it
 *   nl:grp:<store>:any       string  present once the store has sold one
 *   nl:grp:<store>:refunds   string  how far the refunds were read for these
 *   nl:grp:<store>:seen      set     refunds already handled
 *
 * A place is handed over the way a gift is (lib/gifts.ts): written down under
 * the address that took it (lib/imported-purchases.ts), so every door that
 * opens a purchase for an address opens it for them, and the buyer's own
 * checkout opens nothing (lib/bundle-rules.ts deliveredIds).
 *
 * Never one place more than was paid for: a place is the address's mark in
 * the purchase's hash, written first, and the places taken are the hash's
 * length read after it. A mark that finds more marks than places is taken
 * off before anything is handed over. Since 5 November 2026 there is no
 * separate count: one INCR whose answer was lost after Redis did it left a
 * place counted that nobody had, for good (audit SG2, CX-123 rule 24). A
 * mark whose answer was lost belongs to its address, and opening its link
 * again picks it up where it stopped.
 *
 * Each place taken is one of the store's orders in the month it is taken
 * (lib/orders.ts). The checkout held room for every place for a day
 * (lib/order-admission.ts, OPEN_HOURS), and a place taken in that day uses
 * it. Since 18 October 2026 a place taken later is admitted then, like any
 * new order, before anything is handed over: when the store's month has no
 * room, nothing is taken, and the person is told the store is resting and
 * that their place is kept for them. The emails that hand out places are
 * the store's access emails (lib/store-allowance-rules.ts), counted before
 * they go.
