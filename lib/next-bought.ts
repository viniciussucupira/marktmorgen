/**
 * What buyers get next (added 12 October 2026): for each product, which
 * product its buyers went on to buy afterward, how many of them, and how long
 * after, counted from the store's own paid sales.
 *
 * Read before it was built: Kissmetrics and Polar show the order customers buy
 * in, GA4 its path exploration, Triple Whale its product journeys. Each starts
 * from the same question a creator has when choosing what to offer after
 * paying: not what sells, but what the people who bought this went on to buy.
 * "N buyers bought both" (lib/also-bought.ts) said nothing of the order.
 *
 *   - Counted from the store's all-time sales (lib/stats.ts readAllTimeSales),
 *     the same reading "bought both" comes from, by the address each buyer
 *     paid with: one buyer counts once for a pair, however often they bought.
 *   - "Next" is a later purchase: more than an hour after the first one, so a
 *     box ticked at checkout or an offer taken in one click right after paying
 *     — the same visit — is "bought together", not "next".
 *   - Said only from MIN_NEXT buyers up, and only in the creator's studio.
 *   - The time between is the middle one of those buyers' (the median), in
 *     whole days, so one buyer who came back a year later does not move it.
 *
 * Kept a week and read again in the background when the studio opens after six
 * hours: one Redis read for the studio, nothing on a visit to the store.
 *
