/**
 * The facts Marktmorgen Path is read from (lib/path-rules.ts, PathFacts),
 * each from a record the store already keeps (docs/marktmorgen-path.md has
 * the inventory). Nothing here writes, and nothing new is counted for it:
 *
 *   title, line    the store's own record (name, bio)
 *   products       the store's catalog: items not hidden, and the first
 *                  page's listings for what each hands over
 *   social visits  the all-time record of the store's numbers (lib/stats.ts):
 *   visitors       r:<source> for every social network, and u; one command
 *   leads          the same record's fs:<channel>: addresses asked for on the
 *                  store (a free product, the sign-up box, a waitlist)
 *   post links     the store's short links (lib/short-links.ts): one command
 *   sales, money   the creator's own Stripe account, the ledger: paid
 *                  checkouts and one-click extras of this store, each with
 *                  Stripe's livemode, less the refunds made on them
 *
 * Money is counted the way only Stripe can confirm it: a checkout Stripe says
 * is complete and paid, in live mode for a real sale and test mode for the
 * test purchase, never a page that said "thanks". A refund in full takes a
 * sale off; refunds are taken off the money; what Stripe could not be asked
 * about leaves the money unknown (null), so no level moves on it. PayPal's
 * sales carry no test mode and are not counted here (docs/marktmorgen-path.md).
