/**
 * The studio's modules, for the gallery "Add to your store" (653 [WG13],
 * app/studio/add): what each one is called, one plain sentence of what it
 * does, which studio screen opens it, and what has to be true for it to be
 * shown. Pure data and pure helpers: the page reads the store, the role and
 * the deployment, and hands the answers in.
 *
 * Titles, sentences, permissions and conditions follow the studio home's own
 * grid (app/studio/page.tsx, StudioTools): a card is shown here exactly when
 * the home would show its tile. Each permission is also the one the module's
 * own screen asks studioView for, so a card never opens a screen that would
 * send the person away (tests/wg13-add-gallery.test.ts reads both).
 *
 * Every folder of app/studio with a page is either a card below or in
 * NOT_MODULES with the reason it is not one.
