/**
 * A member who pays monthly moving to the same membership's yearly price
 * (added 12 October 2026), as rules the browser can read too. The switch is
 * in lib/yearly-switch.ts; the one email that offers it in lib/yearly-ask.ts.
 *
 * Read before it was built: Patreon, Kajabi, Skool and Memberful sell a
 * yearly price beside the monthly one, and Memberful and Chargebee let a
 * monthly member move to it from their own page, prorated. Until now a
 * member here could only choose yearly when buying.
 *
 * Offered only where it saves the member money and costs the creator
 * nothing they did not agree to:
 *
 *   - a monthly membership (once a month) running until canceled, paid up or
 *     in its trial, not paused, not set to end, one item of one;
 *   - the product still offers its yearly price (lib/yearly-price.ts), in the
 *     currency the member pays in, and that year costs less than twelve of
 *     the member's own monthly payments, so the saving said is theirs;
 *   - no discount on the membership: a coupon for a few months would
 *     otherwise come off a whole year's payment;
 *   - no affiliate share still running for a set number of months: a year
 *     paid at once inside those months would give the affiliate a share of
 *     all twelve. A share for as long as the member pays is the same either
 *     way, so it does not stop the offer.
