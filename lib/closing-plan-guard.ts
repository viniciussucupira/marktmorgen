/**
 * A plan paid for a store that is already closing (queue item 307 [EC1],
 * held to item 569 [NC1]: no wrong charge reaches a customer, and nothing
 * needs a person to put it right).
 *
 * A plan checkout opened before a store's closing day can still be finished
 * on it. From the start of that day the store is being removed and its
 * members' memberships have ended, so a plan paid then would be paid for and
 * never given. So, wherever a plan subscription comes to light while its
 * store is in its closing day (FINAL_INDEX) or after it was removed
 * (the way back from Stripe, the daily sync, the closing job itself):
 *
 *   - it is put in line here (UNDO_KEY) before anything else is done, so a
 *     step that fails is tried again on every later run, never dropped;
 *   - the subscription is ended at once (no final bill, no proration);
 *   - its open invoices are voided and its drafts deleted;
 *   - every payment made for it since the closing day began is refunded in
 *     full. The refund's idempotency key is the invoice and the number of
 *     refunds of that charge that have failed, so a retry of any caller
 *     never refunds twice, and a refund the bank turned down is made again;
 *   - the creator is told, once, that the store had already closed and the
 *     payment was returned;
 *   - only then is it marked settled, its address and name dropped; it is
 *     looked at again on each run for DONE_KEEP_DAYS (a refund the bank
 *     sends back is made again, the creator not told twice), then taken out.
 *
 * When the day starts, the open plan checkouts of the store are expired
 * (POST /v1/checkout/sessions/:id/expire, which only an `open` session
 * takes), so most of these never happen; and a store whose records are gone
 * is still known for SHUT_DAYS by a mark of its hashed address (SHUT_PREFIX).
 *
 *   nl:closing:undo           field a plan subscription, value its Undo: the
 *                             company's; once settled only its dates are
 *                             kept, and taken out DONE_KEEP_DAYS later
 *   nl:closing:shut:<hash>    the closing day's start for a store's address
