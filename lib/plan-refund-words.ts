/**
 * What the plan refund's review page and confirmation email say (305 [SY1]
 * unit 2b2): pure, so the words are tested against the code they describe.
 *
 * Every sentence matches what the code does: the refund comes from the
 * reading of lib/plan-refund.ts and is made by lib/plan-refund-flow.ts, which
 * ends the plan the same day; what happens to the store afterward is the
 * closing of lib/plan-closing-rules.ts, as the Help says
 * (lib/help-content.ts, "What happens when my plan ends?": the closing day
 * stops the renewals the creator sold on their own Stripe account, so the
 * page never says that account is not touched). No reason is asked: the
 * policy says "No reason is required".
