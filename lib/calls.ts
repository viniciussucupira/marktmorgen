/**
 * Booking a paid call, on the creator's own Stripe account.
 *
 * A buyer picks a time, the time is held while they pay, and it becomes
 * theirs once Stripe says the payment went through. Three sources decide
 * whether a time is free, and all three are consulted every time:
 *
 *   - holds: a time somebody is paying for right now, kept for as long as a
 *     Stripe checkout stays open, then released by itself;
 *   - bookings we wrote down when a buyer came back from paying;
 *   - the creator's own Stripe account, which is the ledger. A buyer who paid
 *     and closed the tab before coming back still blocks the time, because
 *     the paid checkout is read from Stripe.
 *
 * Every hold and booking is one seat: a one-to-one call has one per time, a
 * group call up to fifty, a dated live session up to five hundred (the rules
 * are in lib/call-setup.ts). The same booking can be seen twice — written
 * down here and read from Stripe — so seats are counted by checkout session,
 * once each.
 *
 * Emails go out once per booking — to the buyer and to the creator — each
 * with a calendar file, so the call is in both calendars without anybody
 * connecting anything. The buyer's has a link to move the booking to another
 * time themselves (moveBooking), within the creator's notice and at most
 * MAX_MOVES times; the reminders a day and an hour before are sent by the
 * mail job (lib/call-reminders.ts).
 *
 * Where the call happens is the creator's own link, a private video room
 * (lib/call-rooms.ts), or a Google Meet or Zoom meeting made on the
 * creator's connected account for each booking (lib/meet-links.ts), made
 * here when the booking is confirmed and moved here when the booking moves.
 *
 * A fourth source applies to weekly hours only: the creator's own calendars,
 * when they have pasted their private calendar addresses in the studio
 * (lib/calendar-sync.ts). A time they are busy there is not offered, and a
 * calendar that cannot be read takes nothing away — the bookings go on
 * without it. Dated sessions are never hidden by it: the creator put them on
 * that date themselves, so the studio shows the clash instead.
 *
 * A call with weekly hours and one seat can instead be a team event type
 * (lib/team-booking.ts): booked with whichever host is free, or with all of
 * them. Its times come from its hosts' own weeks and calendars, and each
 * booking also takes its hosts' time on every store at once, atomically
 * (lib/host-claims.ts), under the same lock as everything here.
