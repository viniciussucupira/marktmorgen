/**
 * What a refund takes back, decided in one place.
 *
 * A buyer who is refunded in full has been given their money back, and what
 * they bought closes for them the same way everywhere Marktmorgen hands it over:
 *
 *   - the download on the thanks page, and the emailed link to it, stop
 *     working on the next request (lib/store-checkout.ts, readOrder, which
 *     reads the payment from Stripe every time);
 *   - the list of purchases leaves it off (lib/buyer-orders.ts);
 *   - the course closes within ten minutes, the time Stripe's answer about a
 *     student is kept (lib/learn.ts);
 *   - the community closes within five, for the same reason
 *     (lib/community-access.ts);
 *   - a license key given for it is marked revoked by the five-minute job,
 *     which reads the refunds made on the creator's account
 *     (lib/licence-keys.ts, revokeRefunded), so the creator's own software
 *     hears "revoked" from the public check.
 *
 * The rule is the same for all of them: the payment was refunded in full,
 * as Stripe says on the charge, or the bank took it back for good, a dispute
 * Stripe closed as lost (queue 388 [TB14], F38; audit MM-SA-18). A buyer who
 * won a chargeback has their money back exactly as a refunded one has, so
 * the same doors close, after the same delays as above (the jobs that revoke
 * keys, end call meetings and mark reviews read the disputes closed since
 * their last run, as they read refunds). A dispute still open (needs_response,
 * under_review, the warning_ stages) or won by the creator closes nothing:
 * only the final "lost" does. A partial refund keeps access, because the
 * creator chose to keep part of the price, and the buyer keeps what it paid
 * for. A lost dispute closes whatever its amount: Stripe says a dispute's
 * amount is "usually the amount of the charge, but it can differ (usually
 * because of currency fluctuation or because only part of the order is
 * disputed)" (API reference, the Dispute object's `amount`, version
 * 2026-09-30, read 4 November 2026), and nothing on the dispute or the
 * charge tells the two apart. Reading a lost dispute for less than the
 * charge as partial would leave a buyer whose bank took the whole payment
 * back through an exchange rate with everything (inbox C4-9); no tolerance
 * is invented, so a lost dispute is read as the whole payment taken back.
 * The owner confirmed this rule on 4 November 2026 (inbox C4-13): a dispute
 * closed as lost closes the whole order, whatever its amount, because the
 * bank gave the money back to the buyer and Stripe does not say which part
 * of the order was disputed.
 *
 * On the current API Stripe does not send a charge's dispute with it, so
 * refundedInFull() alone sees refunds only. Disputes are seen only through
 * disputeLost() and what is built on it: givenBack(), keptUnlessLost(),
 * purchaseRefunded(), and the jobs' lostDisputesSince(), which the jobs that
 * take back gifts (lib/gifts.ts) and pre-orders already handed over
 * (lib/preorders.ts, revokeRefundedPreorders) read too (queue 388 [TB14],
 * 5 November 2026), and a booking's own row in lib/calls.ts, which asks
 * Stripe with keptUnlessLost() for a charge marked disputed (callOrLost, at
 * most DISPUTE_READS_PER_READING a reading). Door still judged on refunds
 * only (queue 388): the job that takes back group places (lib/group-buy.ts). A payment added in one click after checkout is its own payment and
 * is judged on its own; a product ticked at checkout is part of the
 * checkout's payment and goes with it.
 *
 * What a refund cannot take back: a file already saved, and a product
 * delivered as a link to somewhere else — once the buyer has the address,
 * only the creator can close it there.
