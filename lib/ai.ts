 * put in the creator's mouth about facts nobody gave it: "About you" (the
 * creator's own story) and the guarantee, which is only drafted when the
 * creator's own words state a refund promise. The reviews block is placed,
 * empty of words, where real buyers' reviews will sit.
 *
 * The answer is turned into blocks here and read through lib/sales-page.ts's
