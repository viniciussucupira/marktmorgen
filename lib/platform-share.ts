/**
 * The share of each sale that goes with the prices decided on October 12,
 * 2026 (lib/plan.ts COMMISSION_BPS), taken on the creator's own Stripe
 * account as an application fee, and never more than is owed.
 *
 * Nothing here does anything while COMMISSION_LIVE is off: every rate reads
 * as zero, no fee is set on a checkout, and the daily job finds nothing to
 * settle. It is built ahead of the company that will run it so that, once
 * Stripe has the platform, the switch is the last step rather than the first.
 *
 * What is owed, and on what:
 *
 *   - the plan's share, in lib/plan.ts, of what the buyer paid for the goods:
 *     after any discount, before tax, and without shipping, which is a cost
 *     the creator passes on and not a sale;
 *   - nothing on a sale made inside the creator's free trial, because the
 *     trial is said to be free and a share is a charge;
 *   - nothing for a store that subscribed before the share, which keeps the
 *     price it chose (Store.shared);
 *   - nothing once a plan has ended: no plan, no share;
 *   - less in proportion to what was refunded, and nothing on a sale lost to
 *     a dispute, because a share of money the creator does not keep is a
 *     share of nothing.
 *
 * How it is taken. A fee on a single payment has to be fixed before the buyer
 * pays, and Stripe decides some of what they pay afterward: the code typed in
 * its box, the tax. So the fee set on a checkout is the share of the LEAST the
 * buyer can pay for the goods, which can never be more than the payment
 * itself, and the daily job (settleShares) gives back whatever was taken
 * above the share of what was actually paid. A membership's fee is a
 * percentage Stripe works out on each payment, and is settled the same way.
 * Nothing here can ever take more than the share: the job only gives back.

 * Whether what this file does has been run against Stripe's test mode, on

 * cannot see that, so it is said here, by whoever saw it, and the switch in
 * lib/plan.ts cannot be turned on until it is (tests/plan-margin.test.ts).
 * Stripe's own advice, in writing on October 11, 2026, was to test these
 * flows in test mode before relying on them, because a fee across borders
 * depends on the countries and the configuration. What has to be seen:
 *
 *   1. A checkout with a fee, on a connected account in the United States,
 *      Canada, the United Kingdom and one EEA country, paid, with the fee
 *      landing on the platform.
 *   2. A checkout whose code takes more off than leaves room for the fee is
 *      never set up that way: codesMayTakeOff lowers the fee first. And one
 *      with a code of 100% off still opens and completes.
 *   3. A membership with a percentage, renewed once, the fee on the renewal.
 *   4. settleShares giving back the excess after a discount and the tax, the
 *      share of a refund made from the creator's own dashboard, and all of it
 *      after a dispute is lost; and moving a store's memberships to a new
 *      percentage when its plan changes.
