/**
 * How much of what failed came back (added 12 October 2026). Paddle Retain
 * sells this as "Recovered MRR" and Baremetrics Recover as its dashboard;
 * here it is read from the creator's own Stripe account, so it is their own
 * truth and nothing is written about anybody to work it out.
 *
 * A payment counts as recovered when a renewal of this store was paid in the
 * last 30 days after it had failed at least once: Stripe tried the card more
 * than once, or the member was emailed about it failing (lib/payment-recovery.ts,
 * which only writes about a payment that failed). "After an email" is the
 * second of those: the ones paid once the member had been told.
 *
 * Read when the studio's Membership numbers page opens, at most every ten
 * minutes, never on a visit to the store. And the emails the daily job sent
 * this month, counted as it sends them (lib/dunning-keys.ts).
