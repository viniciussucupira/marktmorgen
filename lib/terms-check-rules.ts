/**
 * Warnings about the terms, refund policy and description a creator wrote or
 * pasted for a product (493 [DE2], the complement to 98
 * [D2-COMPLIANCE-REVIEW]), unit 1: the rule only. Nothing calls it yet; the
 * studio shows the warnings before a product is published, and applies a
 * suggested fix only when the creator approves it, in the next unit.
 *
 * Pure and fixed: no model, no request, nothing changed. Each warning carries
 * the passage it is about, the reason in plain words and a suggested fix. It
 * flags; it does not decide that a text is unlawful. What it looks for:
 *   - another company or site named in the text (a host that is not the
 *     creator's own, or a platform for selling creator products): terms
 *     copied from elsewhere often describe rules that do not apply here;
 *   - a price in the text that is not the price the page and checkout show;
 *   - "no refunds" or the like, when the product is sold where the checkout's
 *     immediate-access consent (item 91, lib/digital-consent.ts) does not
 *     apply to it: a buyer in the EU or the UK usually has 14 days to cancel,
 *     as the Help says (lib/help-content.ts, EU withdrawal);
 *   - a promise of earnings, income or results;
 *   - urgency or scarcity with no real deadline or stock limit behind it;
 *   - resale or private label rights, which the Terms allow only under a
 *     license the creator keeps (app/terms/page.tsx, "Content sold with
 *     resale rights").
 * A sentence that says the opposite is never warned, because the fix would
 * tell the creator to delete a protective sentence: a negation in the same
 * clause before the words ("No resale rights", "we do not guarantee any
 * income") or after them ("resale rights are not included"), and a refund
 * rule that keeps the buyer's two weeks to cancel (closing refunds only
 * after that, or the text granting it). Ordinary product text is left
 * alone: well-known tools a product is made with or delivered on
 * (TOOL_HOSTS), a short domain ending only when written as an address
 * (with "https://", "www." or a path), the creator's own community or tip
 * page ("my Patreon"), amounts that are shipping, tax, a fee or a stated
 * value, and a countdown that is a product rather than a timer.
 * The text read is capped at MAX_TEXT characters and the warnings at
 * MAX_WARNINGS, so a pasted book costs a bounded amount of work.
