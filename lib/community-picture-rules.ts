/**
 * How many pictures a store's community may keep (added 18 October 2026).
 *
 * A member may post a picture of up to a megabyte (lib/product-image.ts,
 * MAX_IMAGE_BYTES), and until this day nothing bounded how many a community
 * kept: they sit in the file store outside the store's own folder, so its
 * storage figure never saw them. Each costs us to keep for as long as it is
 * kept, so each plan has a number, counted at the most a picture may weigh
 * (lib/community-files.ts, takePicturePlace), and tests/plan-cost-registry.ts
 * prices it in every plan's worst month.
 *
 * Client-safe: the pages that publish the number read this one.
