/**
 * Whether Marktmorgen is open.
 *
 * Open means one thing: a creator can start a paid plan, which is the only
 * moment we take a card. While it is not, the site is a preview of something
 * still being built, and it says so on every public page instead of leaving
 * a visitor to work it out from a list: a store can be opened and set up, and
 * no plan can be started (app/api/billing/checkout/route.ts refuses, and the
 * studio shows no button that would be refused).
 *
 * Canceling and keeping an existing subscription do not read this. Changing
 * to a new plan does: an unreviewed commercial release cannot be bypassed.
 *
 * The server and browser read the same answer. Requesting opening is not
 * enough: the per-customer, after-tax margin review must also be complete,
 * the tax gate's setting must be one sales may be judged on (lib/tax-gate.ts:
 * the reading with more tax, closed only by an official text or a recorded
 * consultation answer), and, since 18 October 2026, every jurisdiction where
 * a tax law makes Marktmorgen the supplier of what a store sells (EU VAT,
 * Implementing Regulation 282/2011 art. 9a; the UK; US states; other
 * countries) must have its treatment built and recorded
 * (lib/deemed-supplier.ts, docs/eu-vat-article-9a.md). A store sells only
 * with a plan (lib/store-checkout.ts canSell), so while this is false no
 * store's checkout opens either.
