 {q:"Can I cancel my subscription?",a:"The Terms allow cancellation at any time. Future billing periods are not charged, and access lasts through the period already paid unless a refund applies. The Refund Policy describes the studio controls and email route."},
 {q:"What are the trial and refund terms?",a:"The published trial is "+TRIAL_DAYS+" days for the first store on an account when plans open. Some trial allowances are smaller and paid AI writing is excluded. The first plan payment on an account can be refunded in full on request within "+REFUND_DAYS+" days. An annual refund later retains started months at the monthly price and Stripe's card fee. The separate Store assistant add-on has different refund terms."},
 {q:"What happens when an allowance is used?",a:"Affected new usage can pause until its counter resets or the plan changes. Other limits, consent, permissions and availability checks still apply. The file-delivery allowance is not a hard stop on already-paid downloads. There is no automatic overage charge for the listed plan allowances."},
