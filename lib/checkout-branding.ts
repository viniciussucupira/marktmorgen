/**
 * The store's look on Stripe's payment page (536 [CB1], unit 1; added
 * 1 November 2026): the branding_settings a Checkout Session takes,
 * worked out from what the store already keeps (store.look), so the page a
 * buyer pays on looks like the store they came from, with nothing for the
 * creator to set.
 *
 * Fields, as Stripe's API reference lists them for creating a Checkout
 * Session (docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create, read 1 November
 * 2026): background_color and button_color (a hex color starting with #),
 * border_style (pill, rectangular, rounded) and font_family (a closed list).
 *
 *   colors   the store's own computed palette (lib/store-look.ts,
 *            lookColours): the page's background and the buttons' fill. Each
 *            is sent only when black or white, whichever reads better, has
 *            at least 7:1 on it; a color that fails is left out and Stripe's
 *            own stays;
 *   border   the store's buttons have a small rounding (app/globals.css .btn,
 *            border-radius: var(--r-sm)), so rounded;
 *   font     only a family on Stripe's list that is the store's own: the
 *            Friendly letters are Nunito, which Stripe has; the store's other
 *            families (Geist, Fraunces, Playfair Display, Bricolage) are not
 *            on it, so "default".
 *
 * Wiring it into every place a session is made, in one shared call, is the
 * next unit. Logo and icon only on the creator's own click, also later.
 * Browser-safe: plain data and pure functions.
