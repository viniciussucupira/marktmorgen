/**
 * What happens once an address has proved it holds its inbox: by the emailed
 * link (app/api/auth/callback), or by Google confirming an address it answers
 * for (lib/google-signin.ts). One place, so the two never drift apart.
 *
 *   - With two-step login on (lib/two-step.ts), no session opens: the login
 *     waits for the app's code behind a cookie of this browser alone. A
 *     request to turn it off that has waited its days turns it off here.
 *   - Otherwise a session opens, and what the recovery address opened is
 *     closed, as the sign-in inbox itself has now been used. It opens without
 *     a second step, even for an account that owns a passkey: a team that asks
 *     for one holds it at the door (lib/team.ts teamTwoStepBlocks).
 *   - A session this browser already held is closed, not kept alongside.
 *   - A browser the account has never used is worth an email (noteSignIn).
 *
 * `failed` is where to send the person when nothing could be opened.
