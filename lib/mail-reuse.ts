/**
 * An email that has gone out, used again.
 *
 * A creator writes an email, sends it, and it works. Until now that was the
 * end of it: the people who joined the list the next morning never saw it,
 * and to send it to them the creator had to find it, copy it out and build a
 * sequence by hand. Most never did, so the best thing they had written was
 * read once by whoever happened to be on the list that day.
 *
 * Two things can be done with a sent email, both from the list of what was
 * sent:
 *
 *   Write it again    its subject and text are put back in the composer, as a
 *                     new email, to change and send or schedule.
 *
 *   Keep sending it   it becomes one more email of a sequence, so everybody
 *                     who joins the list from now on gets it by themselves —
 *                     or, when it was written to the people who got one
 *                     product, everybody who gets that product from now on.
 *
 * "Keep sending" invents nothing. It is a sequence (lib/flows.ts) like any
 * other: one the creator can open, reorder, pause or delete under Sequences,
 * counted against the same month of emails, sent only to people who agreed
 * and are still on the list, once each. All this file decides is which
 * sequence the email joins and how long after the one before it.
 *
 * An email written to only some of those people — the ones who have not
 * bought yet, or who do not own another product — keeps that narrowing as
 * the condition of its email in the sequence (lib/flow-rules.ts), read just
 * before it goes, so "you have not bought this yet" never reaches somebody
 * who has. (Until conditions existed, such an email was refused.)
 *
 * What it still refuses, and says so: an email narrowed two ways at once —
 * to buyers of one product who do not own another, say. An email in a
 * sequence carries one condition.
