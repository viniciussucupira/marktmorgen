/**
 * Funnels to start from, by kind (added 13 October 2026).
 *
 * ClickFunnels opens its builder on a choice of funnel types — lead magnet,
 * webinar, challenge, product launch, book, tripwire, application — and a
 * creator coming from it expects to pick one and be handed the shape. A
 * funnel here is already the store's own pages and its products' pages in
 * an order (lib/page-funnel.ts); a type is that order written down once:
 * which products it walks through, in which roles, and which of the store's
 * own pages it needs, with the blocks those pages start with.
 *
 * What a type never does is write a sentence. The pages it makes are empty
 * blocks under the page's title, kept back from visitors until the creator
 * fills them in and lets them out (a funnel passes over a page that is kept
 * back, so a half-made funnel never shows an empty page); the products are
 * the creator's own, chosen from their store. Nothing is priced, promised or
 * counted down for the creator. That is also why there is no "webinar" that
 * pretends to be live: a recorded training is called one.
 *
 * Pure and browser-safe: the studio lists these, and the route that builds a
 * funnel from one (app/api/store/page-funnels) reads the same list.
