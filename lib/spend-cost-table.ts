/**
 * The one table of supplier rates that the automatic spend ceilings are
 * computed from (lib/ai-spend-policy.ts, lib/upload-budget-policy.ts).
 * Client-safe: no secrets, no environment, no network.
 *
 * Every figure is a published list price, read on the date below, or a
 * deliberately high allowance stated as such. Nothing here is an average or
 * a forecast. A changed rate moves every ceiling and every reservation that
 * is computed from it; tests/spend-cost-table.test.ts fails when another file
 * repeats a rate that no longer matches this one.
