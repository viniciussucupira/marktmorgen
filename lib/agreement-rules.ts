/**
 * Proposals and agreements with an electronic signature (HighLevel audit H28;
 * added 18 October 2026): the rules, browser-safe.
 *
 * A creator writes a proposal or an agreement for one person they deal with
 * (a coaching client, a brand): a title, plain text and, if they want, lines
 * with amounts. The person gets one email with a link to a page of the
 * store's that shows the exact text, and signs it there by typing their full
 * name, typing the address it was sent to, and checking that they agree to
 * sign electronically and are the person it was sent to.
 *
 * What is recorded, and nothing more is claimed (docs/agreements-esign.md):
 * the exact text shown, its SHA-256 fingerprint, the version number, the
 * name typed, the time, the consent sentence checked, and a one-way code
 * made from the signer's internet address (never the address itself). It
 * is never called "legally binding" or "court-admissible" here: whether an
 * agreement can be enforced depends on the law where the parties are and on
 * what it says, and every page that shows it says so.
 *
 * A version's text never changes once written (lib/agreement-store.ts keeps
 * it under a key written once). Any edit is a new version, which needs a new
 * signature; an earlier signature stays recorded against the text it signed.
 *
 * No count here is a price figure: each email is one of the store's own
 * emails for the month, each record is counted in the store's data room
 * before it is written, and the caps below only bound what a list reads.
