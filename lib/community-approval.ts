/**
 * 543 [CM2]: approval of posts and comments before they publish, a choice
 * the creator makes per space (added 6 November 2026).
 *
 * For each space, separately for posts and for comments: publish right away
 * (the default, as before), approve the first 1 to 5 of each new member, or
 * approve every one. The creator is never held.
 *
 * What waits is kept apart from the community's posts and comments, never in
 * the feed, a space, a post's comments or the search index (lib/community.ts),
 * so nothing that reads the community can show it to anybody: only its author
 * (heldOf, marked "Waiting for approval") and the creator's queue in the
 * studio (heldQueue) read it. Approving writes it into the community through
 * createPost or addComment, as if it had just been sent; removing keeps a short
 * note for the author, with the creator's sentence; waiting HELD_DAYS without
 * an answer refuses it by itself, with a note too. Nothing is deleted without
 * the author being told.
 *
 * Kept under the community's own id:
 *
 *   nl:cm:<id>:ap:r          the rule of each space: space -> rule (hash)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:ap:q          what waits, by when it was sent (sorted set)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:ap:i:<item>   one item waiting, or the note left for its
 *                            author once it was removed or expired; gone by
 *                            itself KEEP_DAYS after it was sent
 *   nl:cm:<id>:ap:w:<who>    one member's items and notes (sorted set)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:ap:n          how many of each member's posts ("<who>:p")
 *                            and comments ("<who>:c") were approved (hash)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:ap:f          the picture of each held post still on the
 *                            queue: item -> its author and path (hash)
 *
 * A held post's picture is listed apart from its record, which runs out by
 * itself: an item swept, removed or erased after its record ran out still
 * has its picture deleted (review of #3020, finding 3). A line goes when its
 * item leaves the queue, so the list is never longer than the queue.
 *
 * Bounded: at most MAX_HELD waiting in a community and MAX_MINE items and
 * notes per member; a hold past either is refused, and nothing of it stays.
 * Each hold first sweeps a few items that expired (HOLD_SWEEP), more than
 * the one it adds, so what expired never piles up on the queue, and only
 * what still waits counts toward MAX_HELD (finding 4).
 * Each item takes its room in the store's data room before it is written,
 * counted until it is gone by itself (lib/store-data.ts); each member's count
 * takes its room the first time it is written.
 *
 * Every reply is read in its exact shape (CX-123 rule 24): an unknown reply
 * is thrown, so a rule never reads as "publish right away", a queue never
 * reads as empty, and a held item is never published on a reply that was
 * not exactly the item. Approving and removing claim the item by taking it
 * off the queue first (one ZREM, which only one caller can win), so two
 * moderators never publish it twice (rule 25).
 *
 * Deleting a person deletes what they had waiting and their counts
 * (forgetHeldPerson, from lib/community-erasure.ts); the copy of their data
 * includes it (lib/person-copy.ts).
