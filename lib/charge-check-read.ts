/**
 * 569 [NC1], unit 5 (second part): reading the paid invoices of the last 48
 * hours from Marktmorgen's own Stripe account, whole, for the daily charge
 * check (lib/charge-check.ts decides each one).
 *
 * Read from Stripe's pages on 30–31 Oct 2026 ("List all invoices": newest
 * first, `status=paid`, `created[gte]`, `limit` 1 to 100, `starting_after`,
 * the page's example sending `Stripe-Version: 2026-10-28.endive`; "The Invoice
 * object": `lines` is a list with `has_more` and its own `url`,
 * `/v1/invoices/<id>/lines`). See docs/billing-correctness.md, "Design of
 * units 5 and 6".
 *
 * Rules this file keeps:
 * - One fixed API version, CHARGE_CHECK_VERSION: the fields the decision
 *   reads moved in 2025, so nothing here reads the account's default shape.
 * - An invoice is handed on only when it was read WHOLE: every line, every
 *   page of lines. One whose lines could not be read is "unread", never
 *   handed on as if it had fewer lines, and never blocks the others.
 * - Bounded: a time budget (`until`, checked before every call), a cap on
 *   list pages and on line pages per invoice. Where it stopped is a cursor
 *   (the window it was reading and the last invoice id), so the next run
 *   carries on in the same window instead of starting over.
 * - A list page Stripe did not answer, or answered in a shape this file does
 *   not know, stops the run at the same cursor: nothing is guessed. After
 *   MAX_LIST_FAILURES runs in a row there, or once a window is
 *   CURSOR_MAX_AGE_SECONDS old, it is abandoned and reported (`abandoned`),
 *   so one bad page never holds every later run.
 * - Newest first: while a window is being resumed, invoices created after it
 *   began are above the cursor; the next fresh window starts no later than
 *   that window's first run (`readUpTo`), so they are read then. An invoice
 *   can be handed on more than once: the caller decides each invoice id once.
 *
 * It calls only the `get` it is handed, so it is tested against a fake
 * Stripe; `platformGet` is the real one. Nothing runs it yet: the cron and
 * the records it decides against come with the next units.
