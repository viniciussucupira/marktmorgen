/**
 * What each plan covers of the uses that had no monthly figure until 17
 * October 2026, and the words a refusal is told in.
 *
 * Every one of these costs us something each time (a function answering,
 * its database commands, an email, a wait on another service), and each was
 * bounded only per minute, hour or day, or not at all, so no plan's worst
 * month could say what they cost (tests/plan-cost-registry.ts listed them as
 * OPEN). Now each is counted per store in the store's window
 * (lib/allowance-window.ts: its billing month when it pays us, the calendar
 * month otherwise) and refused, with a plain sentence, before the cost is
 * incurred once the figure is used:
 *
 *   studio         every request the studio makes for a store: pages drawn,
 *                  saves, reads, its own refreshing (lib/studio-route.ts).
 *                  Moving to a larger plan, cancelling, signing out and
 *                  downloading the store's own data are never refused.
 *   api            every request to the REST API with one of the store's
 *                  keys (lib/api-guard.ts).
 *   inbox          a message that arrives in the store's inbox: a visitor's
 *                  chat, a contact form (lib/inbox.ts).
 *   email          the emails a store's own paths send that are neither its
 *                  monthly emails (lib/mail.ts) nor an order's: inbox notices
 *                  and replies, a purchase sent again, contact-form and
 *                  inbound-mail notices, checkout reminders, come-back and
 *                  welcome offers, payment reminders to members, the yearly
 *                  offer (tests/plan-cost-registry.ts, EMAIL_SITES).
 *   transactional  the emails that hand a buyer what they have: a link to
 *                  their purchases, a private podcast's link, a member's
 *                  sign-in to the store.
 *   integration    a call to another service made for the store: a meeting
 *                  started or read, a calendar checked by hand, Discord,
 *                  email platforms, Meta ads, PayPal, a business's site read
 *                  for outreach, video upload doors, the vault.
 *   buyer          (since 18 October 2026) what buyers, and the creator,
 *                  do inside what was bought, outside the pages themselves:
 *                  a community post, comment, like, message, RSVP, picture
 *                  door, event, a lesson comment, a hand-in and its upload
 *                  door, a lesson marked done, a certificate made
 *                  (lib/buyer-actions.ts). A buyer is told the store is
 *                  resting for now; nothing they already have is taken away.
 *   webhook        (since 18 October 2026) each try of a webhook delivery to
 *                  one of the creator's endpoints, the first one, each retry
 *                  and each test (lib/webhooks.ts). A delivery past the
 *                  figure is not tried and is marked failed with the reason.
 *
 * The figures are each plan's own, sized so every plan, paid by the month or
 * by the year, keeps the owner's 60% at every figure used in full
 * (tests/spend-floor.test.ts). Prices never change for them.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network: the pages that publish these figures
 * read the same ones the counters do.
