/**
 * A closed store's records in the database, deleted (added 18 October 2026).
 *
 * A store whose plan ended closes on its closing day (lib/plan-closing.ts):
 * its files that day, and every record it keeps here within
 * ERASE_WITHIN_DAYS, so a store that pays nothing stops costing anything.
 * Before this, a closed store's records stayed for ever, a little each month
 * with no payment behind it, and closed stores only ever add up. Nothing of
 * it is copied anywhere first: its sales are on its owner's own Stripe
 * account, and its owner was offered all of it as one file
 * (lib/store-export.ts).
 *
 * What goes, and what is kept, is said family by family in CLOSING
 * (lib/data-families.ts), and tests/closing-families.test.ts fails for a
 * family of tests/store-data-registry.ts that does not say. In order:
 *
 *   1. prepare: what is found only through the store's own record, while it
 *      can still be read (its team, its keys for the API, its webhooks, its
 *      email platform, its phones, its calendar hosts' claims); then the
 *      store record itself, its addresses held back from anyone else for a
 *      month. Its PDFs' previews go on its closing day, with its files.
 *      From then on no page, checkout or job finds the store, so nothing new
 *      is written for it.
 *   2. the walk: the whole database, a page at a time. A key of a family
 *      CLOSING says is erased, named by one of the store's own ids, is
 *      deleted, and what the family's follower finds through it first (the
 *      stop links its contacts were sent, the certificates its courses gave,
 *      the tokens its listeners' feeds open by...). A list of the
 *      company's that names stores loses this store's members. Nothing else
 *      is touched: a key that names no closing store is passed over, and a
 *      person's records across stores lose only this store's part. A
 *      buyer's library, the lists a person joined and an affiliate's hub
 *      (lib/joined-stores.ts) are not walked person by person: what names the
 *      store in them points at nothing once it is gone, is never shown, and
 *      runs out with the quarter it was written in (CLOSING, "lapses").
 *   3. finish: the closing record says when, and its owner is emailed.
 *
 * Stores are deleted together: those that came due since the last walk
 * share the next one, so the database is read once a day at the most,
 * whatever number closes. Each step can be run again; the walk is resumable
 * from where it stopped, page by page, and a key already gone is passed over.
 *
 *   nl:closed:due     sorted set  a store's key -> when its records came due (ms)
 *   nl:closed:batch   hash        a store's key -> what the walk needs of it (JSON), while its walk runs
 *   nl:closed:walk    hash        cursor, started, finished
 *
 * Reading the database is the company's, bounded by its schedule: one walk a
 * day at the most, WALK_COUNT keys a command (docs/funded-exposure-review.md).
 * What is done for each store, its deletes in DEL_BATCH keys a command and
 * what its followers read, is priced once for each store, against its own
 * payments (tests/plan-cost-registry.ts, closure), and the renewals it stops
 * with the orders that sold them (ORDER_COST).
