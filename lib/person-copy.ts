/**
 * A copy of everything one store keeps about one person (619 [SZ3]): the
 * mirror of the erasure (lib/person-erasure.ts). The right of access and of
 * portability (GDPR arts. 15 and 20, UK GDPR, CCPA's right to know) asks
 * for the data itself, in a form a person can read and take elsewhere.
 *
 * Every module the erasure reaches is named in COPY_PLAN, with what the copy
 * does with it:
 *
 *   copied    its records about the person are read and put in the copy;
 *   marks     it keeps only marks with nothing in them to read (that a
 *             reminder was sent, a link that still works, a ten-minute
 *             cache made from Stripe), so the copy says what is held;
 *   elsewhere it is not kept by Marktmorgen at all but on the creator's own
 *             account elsewhere (Stripe), and the copy says where to ask;
 *   pending   it keeps something the copy cannot read yet. While any module
 *             is pending, COPY_COMPLETE is false and no door gives the copy
 *             to anybody: a copy that leaves things out is not the copy the
 *             law asks for (tests/person-copy.test.ts).
 *
 * Only reading: every reader here is one that changes nothing the person or
 * the store would see (no "read" mark, no token made, no cache written).
 * What other people wrote is left out where it is theirs and not about the
 * person: a teammate's address on a note or a deal, who a conversation is
 * given to. What the store wrote to or about the person (a note, a reply,
 * feedback on their work) is in, because it is data about them.
