/**
 * How a page is read, measured cheaply enough to be in the cost of a visit
 * (added 11 October 2026).
 *
 * Two things are measured when a visitor leaves a page:
 *
 *   - on a product's sales page, the furthest block they saw
 *     (lib/page-depth.ts, components/page-depth.tsx);
 *   - on the store's own page, the furthest item they saw — a product, a
 *     link, or a part such as the sign-up box — and the one they clicked, if
 *     they clicked one (components/store-reach.tsx), so the studio can say,
 *     for each item, how many of the people who got as far as it clicked it.
 *
 * Why this file exists. The sales-page measure used to go through the
 * store's general count, which reads the store (two commands), asks the rate
 * limit (two) and wrote three: seven commands and a call on every sales page
 * left, and none of it was in what a visit is costed at (tests/traffic-cost.ts).
 * Every plan's margin is worked out from that cost, so a measure outside it is
 * a loss nothing watches. Now:
 *
 *   - the page carries a token made from the store's statistics id and the
 *     page, signed with a key only this deployment has, so the route needs no
 *     read of the store to know which one it is and that the page is its own;
 *   - the route writes one command;
 *   - only one visitor in READ_SAMPLE sends anything at all, chosen by the
 *     browser at random. A share worked out from a random eighth of the
 *     visitors is the same share, give or take, and the studio says so and
 *     waits for enough of them before it shows one.
 *
 * Nothing about the visitor is sent or kept: no cookie, no address, only
 * which block or item, and on the store page which one was clicked.
