/**
 * Who may read a published email kept for members (lib/letter-rules.ts,
 * membersOnly; queue items 28 [E11] and 100 [E2-MEMBER-PUBLICATIONS], added
 * 4 November 2026), asked again on every page.
 *
 * The answer is the one a community's door gives (lib/community-access.ts,
 * holdsProductsOrThrow): the address holds one of the email's products now, read
 * from the creator's Stripe account and the store's own records, never from
 * anything a visitor says: paid and not refunded in full (a dispute lost
 * counts as refunded), a membership still running, given for free, brought
 * over from another platform, or given as a gift. A refund, a lost dispute
 * or a membership that stops closes the email within the minutes the answer
 * is kept. When Stripe cannot be asked, the answer is unknown, said as such,
 * and never kept.
 *
 * The address has to be proved, as a community's is (lib/learn.ts,
 * learnerFrom with the store's pass for every course): a link emailed to it,
 * or a Marktmorgen sign-in with it. A pass made at checkout for one course
 * only is not enough. The creator always reads their own.
 *
 *   nl:letters:ok:<sid>:<products>:<address>   whether the address holds one of the products, for minutes
 *   nl:letters:link:<hash>                     an emailed link: who, which store, which email (1 hour)
 *   nl:letters:link:<hash>:opens               how often it was used (at most 10)
 *   nl:letters:rl:ip:<hash>, nl:letters:rl:addr:<hash>   how often a link was asked for (an hour)
 *
 * What it costs: the page and the form are each one of the store's public
 * requests (lib/buyer-actions.ts takeBuyerRead), the answer is one cached
 * read, and the link is one of the store's access emails, counted and
 * refused past its allowance by the email meter before it is sent. The form
 * answers before any of that is done (requestLetterLink).
