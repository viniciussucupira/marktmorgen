/**
 * The offers after paying, after a cart (556 [CT1]; added 1 November 2026).
 *
 * A product bought on its own has always been followed by its funnel's
 * offers (lib/upsell.ts). A cart was not: its checkout never kept the card,
 * so whoever paid for two or more products at once met no offer at all. Here
 * is what a cart adds to that, and nothing else; the offers themselves, their
 * charge and every protection are lib/upsell.ts's own, unchanged:
 *
 *   - whose offers: the first product in the cart, in the cart's order, whose
 *     funnel is on (lib/funnel.ts activeFunnel), at most the same five offers;
 *     only when at least one of them is something not in the cart, or the
 *     card is not kept at all;
 *   - never offered: anything in the cart, anything the buyer already has
 *     from this store (their completed checkouts, the offers they took after
 *     paying and what the creator brought over or gave them: ownedHere in
 *     lib/next-offer.ts, the reading the next product after a purchase uses),
 *     and anything they turned down in this order, even when the funnel offers it
 *     again at a lower price after a "no thanks". Each is passed over to
 *     the funnel's next offer, as a "no" would be; when none is left, none is
 *     shown. What they own that cannot be read in full means nothing is
 *     offered: never on a guess;
 *   - the price is the offer's own: the cart's "Buy more, save more" deal is
 *     not taken off it again (takeUpsell charges the step's price, nothing else).
 *
 * Cost: what the buyer owns is read from the creator's own Stripe account and
 * the store's brought-over purchases, only for a cart order whose offers are
 * open to this browser, and every reading counts CART_OFFER_REQUEST_UNITS of
 * the store's public requests before it is made (lib/buyer-actions.ts), so it
 * stays inside the figure each plan already has; past it, nothing is offered.
 * No new supplier, nothing written, no key of its own. It is read again on
 * each opening of the page and each answer, inside that count, rather than
 * kept: keeping it needs a new kind of record, registered in
 * tests/store-data-registry.ts (on the queue). Both readings fail closed, so
 * the page and the answer can only disagree by showing nothing.
 *
 * Known gap: ownedHere gives up (nothing offered) for an address with more
 * than three of the creator's customers, so a buyer's fourth checkout with
 * offers is followed by none. Safe, not yet good.
