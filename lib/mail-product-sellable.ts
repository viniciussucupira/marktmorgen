/**
 * The server side of a product card in an email (546 [EB1], unit 1; added
 * 4 November 2026): which products a buyer can get from the store right now,
 * and the facts its price is written from. The rules and the drawing are in
 * lib/mail-product-block.ts and lib/mail-product-price.ts.
 *
 * An email points a reader at a product, so it names only one the reader
 * could get on its page today, by the same checks the store uses there:
 *
 *   - on a store that is not suspended (its pages rest: StoreResting);
 *   - published: a draft is out;
 *   - not coming soon, pre-orders included (lib/preorders.ts, one read for
 *     the whole email): an email is no place to take a pre-order, and a
 *     failed read leaves every product out rather than guessing;
 *   - not sold out: a limited product with 0 left is out, and so is one
 *     whose stock cannot be read (lib/stock.ts); a product handing out
 *     licence keys from a pool is out while the pool is empty or cannot be
 *     read (outOfKeys, lib/licence-keys.ts);
 *   - a call: only while a date is still on sale (hasDateOnSale,
 *     lib/call-on-sale.ts); weekly hours always are;
 *   - free: only while the store can give it (canGiveProduct, lib/free.ts);
 *   - paid: only while the store can sell it through Stripe
 *     (canSellProduct, which needs canSell, lib/store-checkout.ts) or
 *     PayPal (paypalReady, lib/paypal-sales.ts), as its page offers it;
 *   - a bundle: only while it holds enough to hand over, counted as its own
 *     page counts it (offeredItems in lib/bundles.ts and bundleReady in
 *     lib/bundle-rules.ts); a failed read leaves it out.
 *
 * What one call costs, read from the code: the pre-orders read (soonState),
 * the bundles' items (offeredItems), and per product passed one stock read
 * with up to its MAX_CHECKS questions to Stripe (stockLeft, lib/stock.ts)
 * and one LLEN of its key pool (outOfKeys). Nothing calls it yet. Contract
 * for the unit that sends an email with product cards (546 [EB1]), before it
 * is switched on:
 *   - pass only the products the email's blocks name (productBlocksIn,
 *     lib/mail-product-block.ts), never the whole catalog;
 *   - bound how many distinct products one email may name, so a call's reads
 *     have a ceiling, and refuse an email over it in plain words;
 *   - call this once per send or per batch of one email, never per reader;
 *   - register those reads at that ceiling as the email's own line in
 *     tests/plan-cost-registry.ts (Revisor 3, C2-73, 4 November 2026).
