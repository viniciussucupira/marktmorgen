/**
 * A funnel's results (525 [FN1], unit 1; added 1 November 2026): the
 * summary across its steps and the period it covers, worked out from counts
 * read elsewhere (the store's own counts, and sales read from the creator's
 * own Stripe account in lib/stats.ts), never typed and never guessed.
 *
 *   - a count that could not be read stays unknown: every figure that needs
 *     it says "Unavailable", never 0 (as lib/funnel-metrics.ts already does);
 *   - money is in the store's currency, in its smallest unit; refunds are
 *     shown apart and taken off the revenue the summary shows;
 *   - the average order and the revenue per visit are divisions said as
 *     such, and a division by nothing is not a number shown;
 *   - the period is a day boundary in the creator's own time zone.
 *
 * Unit 2 adds one-time and recurring on each step, with the summary made
 * from the steps. Recording the funnel on each sale and sign-up, reading the
 * counts, their cost under the plan's ceiling, and the panel are the next
 * units. Browser-safe: plain data and pure functions.
