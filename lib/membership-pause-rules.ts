/**
 * A member pausing their membership instead of cancelling it (added 11
 * October 2026; lib/membership-pause.ts on the server).
 *
 * Read before it was built: Kajabi lets the creator pause somebody by hand
 * (lib/save-offer.ts says where that was read); here the member does it
 * themselves, from the same page they would cancel from, when the creator
 * allows it. Somebody going away for the summer, or short of money for a
 * month, keeps their place rather than leaving for good.
 *
 * How it works, so nobody pays for what they do not get and nobody gets what
 * they did not pay for:
 *
 *   - The pause starts when the period already paid for ends: the member
 *     keeps what they paid for to the last day.
 *   - It lasts the months they chose, up to what the creator allows (1, 2 or
 *     3). Stripe skips the payments in that time (pause_collection, void),
 *     and the membership's doors — its files, its course, its community —
 *     are closed for it, like any membership not being paid for.
 *   - It ends by itself on the day it was set to: Stripe takes the next
 *     payment and the doors open again. Or the member resumes early, which
 *     takes a payment that day and starts a new period from it, so an early
 *     return is never a free stretch of days.
 *   - Only on a membership charged once a month, running normally: not on
 *     one in its free trial, behind on a payment, already set to end, sold
 *     to end after a set number of payments, or paused already. And once a
 *     year at most, so a pause is a break and not a cheaper way to belong.
 *
 * Browser-safe.
