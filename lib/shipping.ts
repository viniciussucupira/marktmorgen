/**
 * Physical products, shipped by the creator (added 11 October 2026): a
 * printed book, a poster, a T-shirt, a box of the planner on paper.
 *
 * Measured before it was built: Stan has no physical products; its help
 * center suggests a digital product with address questions and shipping
 * worked out by hand. Gumroad and Beacons sell them. Here it is a product
 * like any other, with three things of its own:
 *
 *   - Where it ships: the countries the creator sends to, picked from a few
 *     regions or listed one by one. Stripe's own checkout asks the buyer for
 *     an address in one of them, so nobody pays for something that cannot
 *     reach them.
 *   - What shipping costs: one amount per order, or nothing, added on
 *     Stripe's page as its own line before the buyer pays.
 *   - A line about when it ships, in the creator's words.
 *
 * The creator ships it themselves. The address is on the sale in the studio
 * and in their Stripe dashboard; pressing "Mark as shipped" emails the buyer,
 * with a tracking link if there is one (lib/shipments.ts).
 *
 * It is sold once, at one price or at several (sizes or versions: S, M, L;
 * signed or not), on its own: not with a price the buyer names, a payment
 * plan, a cart, a gift or a group purchase, and it delivers no file, link,
 * course or call besides. A limited quantity and
 * the boxes at checkout work as they do on any product.
 *
 * Browser-safe: the studio reads the same rules the server holds it to.
