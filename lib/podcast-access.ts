/**
 * Who may listen to a private podcast (lib/podcast-rules.ts).
 *
 *   nl:pod:t:<sha(token)>              the feed a token opens: store, product, address
 *   nl:pod:by:<store>:<product>:<key>  the token an address already has, so it keeps one feed
 *   nl:pod:ok:<store>:<product>:<key>  whether that address holds the product, for a few minutes
 *   nl:pod:n:<sha(token)>:<day>        how often a feed was put together that day
 *
 * A feed address is a secret: whoever has it can listen. So every read of it
 * and every episode fetched asks whether its address still holds the product
 * (lib/community-access.ts holdsProducts, the same answer a community's door
 * gives), and a feed that is fetched far more than any one person's apps do
 * is slowed down.
 *
 * What a feed costs, and why it is answered the way it is. A podcast app
 * asks for its feed about once an hour, day and night, whether or not
 * anybody is listening, and each time it was answered by putting the feed
 * together again: the store, the product, whether the address still holds
 * it, the episodes. A subscriber cost about three visits a day that way and
 * was counted as none. Two things now hold it:
 *
 *   - The feed is answered once and then kept by the CDN for
 *     FEED_SHARED_SECONDS, so an app's hourly question is answered without
 *     anything being put together. A new episode reaches an app within that
 *     time of being published. An address whose access has ended keeps its
 *     list of episodes that long too, and no longer: each episode itself is
 *     asked about every time it is fetched, and is refused at once.
 *   - A subscriber is one visit to the store on each day their app asks
 *     (lib/traffic.ts, recordListener), which is what the day costs at the
 *     most: the feed can be put together FEED_READS_A_DAY times a day for
 *     one address and no more.
