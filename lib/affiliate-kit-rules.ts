/**
 * Posts an affiliate shares, drafted for them (added 11 October 2026;
 * lib/affiliate-kit.ts, lib/ai.ts writeAffiliatePosts).
 *
 * An approved affiliate picks one of the store's products and, if they like,
 * says in a line who they share with and how they know the product. Three
 * posts come back — for X, Instagram and LinkedIn — written from the
 * product's own page, in the store's language, as a recommendation in the
 * affiliate's voice. Each one carries their own link to the product and,
 * always, a line saying they earn from it.
 *
 * That line is not left to the model. It is written here, in each language,
 * and added to every post after the model answers, so no draft can go out
 * without it: in the United States the FTC holds the brand responsible for an
 * affiliate's undisclosed recommendation, and in Europe the law on unfair
 * commercial practices asks the same. The model is also told never to claim
 * the affiliate used the product unless their own line says so, and never to
 * promise a result.
 *
 * Who pays for it. Each draft is one of the store's own writing jobs for the
 * month (lib/ai-rules.ts, AI_MONTHLY), which every plan's price already
 * covers, so it costs nothing a plan was not priced for. Two limits keep it
 * the creator's: a few drafts a day for each affiliate, and never more than a
 * quarter of the store's month for its affiliates together. The creator can
 * switch it off (AffiliateSetting.kit).
 *
 * Browser-safe.
