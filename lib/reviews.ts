/**
 * Reviews that only buyers can write.
 *
 * On Stan a creator types their reviews in themselves. Here a review can only
 * come from somebody who paid: it is written from the thanks page, from the
 * list of purchases or from the link in the one email that asks for it, and
 * every one of those doors first asks the creator's own Stripe account
 * whether that order was paid and not refunded (lib/review-proof.ts). Each
 * review keeps the order it came from, so the creator can find the payment
 * behind any review in their own Stripe dashboard.
 *
 * The rules, all kept here so every page applies the same ones:
 *
 *   - One review per buyer per product: the id is made from the store, the
 *     product and the buyer's address, so buying twice is still one voice.
 *     The buyer can change it or delete it, through the same doors.
 *   - Stars from 1 to 5 and up to 1,000 characters, with the name the buyer
 *     chooses to show (or "Verified buyer"). Their email is never shown.
 *   - The creator can answer in public, and can hide a review only for one of
 *     the review rules (HIDE_REASONS: private information, abuse, not about
 *     the product, clearly false, unlawful), the same for every rating; the
 *     reason is kept with it. They cannot change a word of it, and there is
 *     no field for anything given in return for writing one.
 *   - Hiding takes a review's words off the page, never its stars out of the
 *     average: the average and the count include hidden reviews, and the
 *     page says how many are hidden ("2 reviews hidden by the creator"). So
 *     hiding can tidy a page but can never lift a rating.
 *   - A refund in full marks the review "refunded" and takes its stars out of
 *     the average and the count, because it no longer comes from a buyer who
 *     kept what they paid for. Its words stay, marked as such.
 *   - Stars show when at least one review counts, hidden or not. New reviews go live at once; the creator's queue in the
 *     studio lists what arrived since they last looked.
 *
 * Records in Redis, all under the store's statsId:
 *
 *   nl:rev:<s>:<product>      -> hash: review id -> the review, as JSON
 *   nl:rev:vis:<s>:<product>  -> sorted set of the ids on the page, by date
 *   nl:rev:sum:<s>            -> hash: product -> the numbers the pages show
 *   nl:rev:all:<s>            -> sorted set of "<product>|<id>", by date (studio)
 *   nl:rev:new:<s>            -> sorted set of the same, not seen yet (the queue)
 *   nl:rev:pay:<s>            -> hash: payment -> the reviews it paid for (refunds)
 *   nl:rev:stores             -> set of statsIds with any review (the refund pass)
