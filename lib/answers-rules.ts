/**
 * A visitor's question about a product, answered from what its page says.
 * Rules the browser can read too; the part that asks the model, counts and
 * remembers is lib/answers.ts, which only the server loads.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (7 October 2026): Kajabi sells a "Sales
 * Agent" that answers pre-purchase questions on landing and checkout pages,
 * at $79 a month for each agent on top of its plan. Hotmart's Tutor and
 * Stan's AI Twin answer members and fans, after the sale. A visitor with one
 * question left — is it a PDF, how long do I have access, is there a refund —
 * either finds the answer in the next few seconds or leaves.
 *
 * What it is, and what keeps it honest:
 *
 *   - Off until the creator switches it on. An answer given in a creator's
 *     name is theirs to allow.
 *   - It answers only from what the product's own page says — its title,
 *     price, description, the blocks of its sales page — and from the notes
 *     the creator writes for it. When the page does not answer the question,
 *     it says exactly that, and the question is shown to the creator (with
 *     no name, address or anything else about who asked), who then knows what
 *     their page is missing. That list is the second half of the feature.
 *   - It never states a price, a refund, a deadline or a result that is not
 *     on the page, and the box says in plain words that the answer is
 *     automatic.
 *
 * What keeps it from costing more than it earns. Each answer is one request
 * to the smallest current model (Haiku 5.5 at $0.10 and $0.50 per million
 * tokens in and out, as lib/spend-cost-table.ts holds it). A store gets a
 * number of answers a month by its plan, below, priced into the plan's
 * automatic monthly AI ceiling (lib/ai-spend-policy.ts); past either the box
 * closes by itself until the month turns. The same question about the same
 * page is answered from memory for a day and costs nothing.
 */

/**
 * Answers a store's visitors may be given in a window (lib/allowance-window.ts: a billing month when the store pays), by where the
 * store stands with its plan. Lowered on October 17, 2026 with the writing
 * jobs (lib/ai-rules.ts, AI_MONTHLY) to what each plan's 60% after-tax floor
 * leaves room for; Store and the free trial have none.
