/**
 * What an order really keeps in the database, counted as it is written
 * (added 18 October 2026, after lib/store-data.ts).
 *
 * Until this day every order counted took a fixed ORDER_DATA_BYTES and
 * ITEM_DATA_BYTES for each product it handed over from its store's data
 * room, for good: the most every record an order could ever leave weighs,
 * whether it left them or not. A Store's room then held about 2,000
 * one-product orders, after which new checkouts paused. But most orders
 * write a small part of that: a buyer's contact and their library entry,
 * a course's place in their record, and, for a buyer who has bought before,
 * almost nothing new at all.
 *
 * So the records an order leaves are written here, and each write is
 * charged what it really adds, measured by Redis itself in the same script
 * that makes it: a new key its name and ORDER_KEY_BYTES, a new field, member
 * or list item its name, its value and ORDER_ENTRY_BYTES (a board's member
 * ORDER_BOARD_ENTRY_BYTES and its score), a value made longer what it grew
 * by, and a quarter more of all that for what Redis's allocator rounds each
 * piece up to, rounded up to DATA_STEP_BYTES. Nothing is refused here (a
 * buyer who paid gets everything); the room for it was held at the checkout,
 * at the most an order can take (lib/order-admission.ts, orderDataBytes),
 * and what the order did not use is let go when the checkout settles.
 *
 * What this errs toward. A value written shorter, a field deleted, a key
 * that expires: none is given back here, so the room looks fuller than it
 * is, never emptier. scripts/test_order_data_redis.py runs the script on a
 * real Redis and holds the charges at or above what Redis itself says it
 * keeps for them (MEMORY USAGE, every sample), at every step, through every
 * change of encoding a hash, a set or a board goes through as it grows. The
 * script is written out whole, its sizes as numbers, so that test can run it
 * as it is; tests/order-data.test.ts holds them to the constants below.
