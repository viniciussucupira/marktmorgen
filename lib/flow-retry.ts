/**
 * When a workflow step that has to wait is tried again, and when a run stops
 * waiting (added 18 October 2026, ClickFunnels audit row F23).
 *
 * A wait whose end is known is tried once, at that end: the month's emails
 * at the turn of the store's allowance window, the company's daily room at
 * the next UTC day, a pause on the store's email at the pause's end.
 * Anything else (the sender's ceiling, a portion of a new list, a read that
 * did not answer, the deals board) is tried again after a delay that grows
 * threefold each time: 10 minutes, 30, 90, 4.5 hours, 13.5, then a day.
 *
 * Every wait is counted on the run (lib/flow-runs.ts, countWaits), and a run
 * stops once it would wait more than MAX_WAITS_PER_RUN times, or one step has
 * waited more than MAX_WAIT_DAYS_PER_STEP days (lib/flow-limits.ts). It stops
 * with nothing done at that step, and its history says why. A count that
 * cannot be read stops it too: an unknown count is not room for one more.
 *
 * Pure and browser-safe.
