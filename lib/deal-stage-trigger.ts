/**
 * "A deal entered a stage" as a workflow trigger (added 17 October 2026,
 * HighLevel audit H18's stage trigger): what starts the one workflow a
 * stage of a pipeline may start (lib/flows.ts, trigger "stage").
 *
 * A deal enters a stage when the store's team makes it in that stage, or
 * moves it there from another stage or pipeline, on the board. Three other
 * ways a deal lands in a stage start nothing, on purpose: a form response
 * made into a deal (that review never enrolls anybody,
 * docs/form-opportunity-conversion.md), the moves made when a stage or a
 * pipeline is removed (the creator tidying the board, not a deal moving
 * on), and a workflow's own deal step (a run's cost has a fixed ceiling,
 * lib/flow-limits.ts; a step that starts another workflow is how one hands
 * a person on, and it is priced as a step).
 *
 * Only the person the deal names, by address, and only while they are on the
 * store's list and agreed to hear from the creator (lib/flows.ts, enroll):
 * a deal with nobody named, or with somebody who never joined the list,
 * starts nothing and sends nothing.
 *
 * What it costs: on a plan with workflows, the check is one more of the
 * store's studio requests (STAGE_TRIGGER_UNITS), taken before it is made;
 * a run it starts counts in the day's runs like every other
 * (lib/flow-limits.ts). On a plan without workflows nothing is read.
