/**
 * How many of a store's API requests a reading takes when it reads more than
 * one request's worth (lib/api-read.ts, lib/mcp-tools.ts).
 *
 * A request is one of the store's monthly figure, priced at a light request:
 * the key, the store and the answer (tests/plan-cost-registry.ts, UNIT_COST.api),
 * and nothing more. Every reading past the door takes, on top, the further
 * requests its work below adds up to, and is refused with 429 when they are
 * not left: a page of products (its listings), of the list or of the members
 * (set aside at its most before the scan, settled at its rows as they came
 * back, before they are sent), a course's
 * students (each one's progress), the affiliates (the whole program and pages
 * of the creator's Stripe account), the bookings (up to five pages of it and
 * every booking's move, a hundred at an MGET), the numbers (ninety days of counts and up to
 * NUMBERS_STRIPE_PAGES pages of sales, renewals, refunds and disputes), the
 * memberships, the emails and what they sold, the recent events and the
 * discount codes. Whatever can be counted first (the program, the PayPal
 * sales and refunds, the listings a page needs, the emails' records, a kept
 * copy's size) is counted first; what cannot is taken at its most, or set
 * aside at its most and settled once measured (lib/api-guard.ts,
 * holdMoreApi). A store's own record, the key and the answer's envelope are
 * the door's.
 *
 * One further request pays for at most one of these, in any mix that adds up
 * to one: API_UNIT_COMMANDS database commands, API_UNIT_BYTES bytes read from
 * the database, API_UNIT_SENT_BYTES bytes sent to the caller, API_UNIT_STRIPE_PAGES
 * pages of a Stripe list waited on, API_UNIT_ROUND_TRIPS trips to the database
 * waited on one after another. tests/plan-cost-registry.test.ts holds each
 * figure under a request's price and every reading's units above its cost at
 * every size. Pure: no reads here.
