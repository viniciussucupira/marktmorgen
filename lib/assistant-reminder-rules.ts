/**
 * The Store assistant's third function (added 17 October 2026): ONE reminder
 * email after a checkout left unpaid, only to a buyer who asked for it at
 * checkout, with one short line an AI writes from the products in that
 * checkout. Rules the browser can read too; what keeps the consent, reads
 * the checkout, asks the model and sends is lib/assistant-reminder.ts.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (17 October 2026, official pages): Kajabi,
 * ClickFunnels and HighLevel send abandoned-cart emails from workflows the
 * creator writes, and HighLevel's and Shopify's start from the address typed
 * at checkout. Here nothing is inferred from an address being typed: the
 * buyer checks a box that says exactly what they will get, the sentence they
 * checked is kept with the time and its version, and the email quotes it.
 *
 * The legal design is the conservative one, because the owner has not yet
 * confirmed with counsel which basis the EU's rules allow for this email
 * (consent, or a legitimate interest): it rests on consent alone.
 *
 *   - The box starts unchecked, says "Email me a reminder if I don't finish
 *     this order" in the store's language, and needs the buyer's address
 *     typed beside it. Not checked, or no valid address: no reminder, and
 *     the checkout opens all the same.
 *   - One reminder per checkout, at the most, about an hour after it closed
 *     unpaid (ASSIST_REMIND_AFTER_SECONDS). None when it was paid, when the
 *     address paid for those products since in another checkout, when the
 *     address pressed stop on the store's reminders, left the creator's list,
 *     bounced, or was deleted from the store (lib/suppression.ts), or when it
 *     heard about the same products this week.
 *   - CAN-SPAM: from the creator's name, with the postal address the creator
 *     gave for reminders (none given: the box is not shown, nothing is sent,
 *     and the studio says why), a stop link that works at once and a
 *     one-click unsubscribe header, and a subject that says what it is.
 *   - No urgency, scarcity, countdown, discount, code, figure or testimonial:
 *     the email says the product, its link and today's price, as the store
 *     shows them, and nothing else is offered.
 *   - The AI's part is one short neutral line about the products in that
 *     checkout, from their titles, descriptions and how each is delivered,
 *     labeled as written by AI; a line with a number, a link, an
 *     exclamation, a deal or pressure word, or that is too long is never
 *     sent (neutralLine). When the add-on's month of replies is spent, the
 *     model fails or the line does not hold, the fixed reminder goes out
 *     with no AI line at all.
 *
 * What it costs: the AI line is one reply of the add-on's month, reserved
 * from the same pool at the same worst cost as a chat message
 * (ASSISTANT_POOL) before the model is asked, settled at what it billed,
 * given back when nothing was billed; its request is inside a chat reply's
 * caps (withinReminderReply), so the add-on's month is unchanged. The email
 * is one of the store's own emails (store-email, lib/email.ts), checked for
 * room before the model is asked and taken before it is sent; the reads and
 * Stripe calls around it are ASSIST_REMIND_REQUEST_UNITS of the store's
 * public requests.
