/**
 * The yearly plan, offered once, at the moment a store first sells.
 *
 * Why then (11 October 2026). The store this one is first compared with,
 * Stan, loses about 13% of its creators every month (Contrary, August 2026):
 * a creator stays seven months on average. A creator on a yearly plan cannot
 * drift off in month three, and a creator who has just been paid by a
 * stranger is the one most sure the store is worth keeping. Asking before
 * that is asking somebody to commit to a tool that has not yet done anything
 * for them; asking much later is asking after the doubt has set in.
 *
 * What it is, precisely:
 *
 *   - The first paid sale of a store is noted once (noteFirstSale), from the
 *     five-minute pass over every selling store's checkouts
 *     (lib/checkout-sweep.ts). A tip is not a sale, and neither is anything
 *     that charged nothing.
 *   - At that moment, a store on a monthly plan that is paid up or in its
 *     trial, not set to stop and with no change of plan waiting, is written
 *     to once: what was sold, and what the yearly plan saves. Never again for
 *     the same subscription, however many first sales it is later told of.
 *   - The studio shows the same offer open, instead of folded away, from then
 *     on (firstSaleAt), until the store pays yearly.
 *
 * The price is the one on the pricing page (lib/plan.ts): the saving is a
 * fact of the published prices, not a discount made for the occasion, so
 * there is nothing that ends, and the email says no more than that.
