/**
 * One buyer, on one page of the studio (added 11 October 2026): everything a
 * person has done with this store, so the creator can answer them, thank
 * them or offer them the next thing knowing who they are.
 *
 * DataFast's visitor journey, Kissmetrics' person reports, Baremetrics' and
 * ChartMogul's customer pages and PostHog's revenue on a person all start
 * from the same idea: a total is a crowd, and a sale is somebody. Those tools
 * keep a log of every visitor to build that page. We keep none (visits are
 * counted per day without a cookie, lib/stats.ts), and this page needs none:
 *
 *   - what they paid, when, for what, through which channel, and what was
 *     given back, is asked of the creator's own Stripe account each time
 *     the page opens — the record of who paid for what, as everywhere else
 *     (lib/buyer-orders.ts). Nothing about money is written down here;
 *   - whether they are on the list, and which sequences they were started
 *     on, is the store's own list (lib/contacts.ts, lib/flows.ts);
 *   - how far they are in each course they bought is the course's own record
 *     of its students (lib/learn.ts);
 *   - and what the creator's team wrote about them is the one thing kept
 *     here: short notes, under a key made from the address, never the
 *     address itself.
 *
 * So the page costs nothing on a store's visits: it is read when somebody on
 * the team opens it, and only then (tests/plan-margin.test.ts is untouched).
 *
 * Who sees it: whoever may read orders with the buyer's address
 * (lib/team-roles.ts, "orders"): the owner, an Admin and Support.
 *
 * The address never travels in a link. A sale in the studio opens its buyer
 * by the sale's own Stripe reference, and an address typed into the search is
 * swapped for a token that works for an hour, for the store it was typed on.
 *
 *   nl:person:<statsId>:who            set of the people with notes
 *   nl:person:<statsId>:n:<person>     hash: <id> → JSON { at, by, text }
 *   nl:person:find:<token>             JSON { s: store id, e: address }, an hour
