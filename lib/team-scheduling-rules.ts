/**
 * Team event types: one call that can be booked with any of several people
 * on a store's team (round robin), or only at times all of them are free
 * (collective). The rules, with no network and no secret, so the studio can
 * draw exactly what the server enforces.
 *
 * A team event type is a call with weekly hours and one seat per time
 * (lib/call-setup.ts) plus a team: the people who host it, each with their
 * own week in their own time zone, their own gap between calls, their own
 * notice and a cap on how many of these calls they take in one of their days.
 * The call's own notice, horizon and gap still apply; a host's stricter one
 * wins for that host.
 *
 * A time is offered when, for round robin, at least one host is free for the
 * whole call, or, for a collective call, every host is. A host is free when:
 *
 *   - the call starts after both notices and within the horizon;
 *   - the whole call fits inside one of the host's stretches of that day, on
 *     their clock (daylight saving is asked of the time zone database at the
 *     exact instant, as everywhere else);
 *   - nothing the host is already taken for (a booking or a hold anywhere on
 *     Marktmorgen, or a busy time in their own calendar) comes within the gap;
 *   - fewer than their daily cap of team calls start on that day of theirs;
 *   - their calendar was read recently enough (`blocked` is false). A host
 *     whose calendar could not be read is never offered: a time is lost
 *     rather than booked over a meeting nobody could see. The other hosts'
 *     times stay on offer.
 *
 * Round robin hands the booking to the free host with the fewest bookings of
 * this event so far, then the fewest coming up, then by address, so the
 * order never depends on who asked first. The server claims that host's time
 * atomically (lib/host-claims.ts) and moves to the next free host when the
 * claim loses a race.
