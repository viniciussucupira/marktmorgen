/**
 * A store's own pages (added 11 October 2026): an About page, a page for
 * coaching, a "Start here", a page of questions — beside the store page and
 * the products' pages, at the store's address and on its own domain
 * (/@chef/about, chef.com/about), and linked from the top of the store.
 *
 * A store was one page and its products. Kajabi, Podia and Teachable build a
 * whole site; a creator coming from one of them had nowhere to put the pages
 * they had there. Each page here is built from the same blocks as a
 * product's page (lib/sales-page.ts), drawn by the same components, with the
 * same three rules: nothing typed is read as markup, a video is one of three
 * players rebuilt from its id, and no block can state a price.
 *
 * Only the blocks that mean something without a product of its own are
 * offered (SITE_KINDS). A button leads to the store, or to one product the
 * creator picks for the page; a product card shows a product as it is sold.
 *
 * Kept as a short list on the store's record (id, address, title, whether it
 * is in the menu), and each page's blocks in the record a product's page
 * uses, under `site-<id>` (lib/sales-page-store.ts). Browser-safe.
