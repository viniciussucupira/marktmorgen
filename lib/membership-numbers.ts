/**
 * How a store's memberships are doing, in the numbers a subscription business
 * is run on: recurring revenue, members, churn and trials that became paying.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (30 September 2026): Whop shows MRR, ARR,
 * churn rate, churned revenue and trial conversion; Circle shows MRR, churn
 * and trial conversion from its payments page. Stan's analytics count store
 * visits and sales. Here the figures are worked out from the creator's own
 * Stripe account — every membership of this store Stripe holds — so they
 * are the creator's own truth, not a copy that can drift.
 *
 * What each figure means, exactly, because a number nobody can check is a
 * number nobody should act on:
 *
 *   - Monthly recurring revenue: every paying membership (active, or with a
 *     payment being retried), at its list price, before discounts and tax,
 *     turned into a month — a yearly one counts a twelfth, a weekly one 52
 *     twelfths. Memberships still in their free trial are counted apart.
 *   - Churn over 30 days: of the memberships that were paying 30 days ago,
 *     the share that has ended since.
 *   - Trials that became paying: of the free trials that ended in the last
 *     90 days, how many were still running a day after the trial ended.
 *
 * Payment plans are not memberships and are left out. Only one currency is
 * summed, the store's own; memberships sold in another before the store
 * changed its currency are counted as members and said apart.
 *
 * Read at most MAX_PAGES pages of 100 and kept CACHE_SECONDS, so the page
 * that shows them asks Stripe at most once every few minutes.
