/**
 * Alerts about a store's numbers (added 12 October 2026): visits that fell
 * away, sales from visits that fell while visits held, refunds piling up, and
 * the month's goal — off pace, or reached. By email, on the creator's phone,
 * and in their Slack or Discord channel when they asked for posts there.
 *
 * Read before it was built: Plausible's traffic spike and drop alerts, Pirsch's
 * "no traffic today", Polar's and Triple Whale's anomaly agents, Baremetrics in
 * Slack, Matomo's custom alerts on any figure. The email when sales stop
 * entirely (lib/quiet-sales.ts) already existed; these catch what goes wrong
 * before that: a link in a bio pointing elsewhere halves the visits, a page
 * edit that stopped selling halves the sales from them.
 *
 * Each is said only when the numbers are big enough to mean it and the change
 * is unlikely to be chance: the store's own last four weeks set the usual
 * level, and the recent days are compared with it as counts are (a Poisson
 * chance), so a small store's ordinary quiet days never raise one. Each kind
 * is said at most once a week, the goal ones once a month.
 *
 *   traffic     visitors over the last 3 full days under 40% of the usual,
 *               at least 20 a day usual, a chance under 1 in 1,000;
 *   conversion  sales from the last 7 days' visitors under half of what the
 *               4 weeks before would give, at least 6 expected, a chance under
 *               1 in 100, with visits not fallen away themselves;
 *   refunds     at least 3 in 7 days and three times the usual week's, a
 *               chance under 1 in 100;
 *   goal        on the 10th or later, a month that at its pace ends under 85%
 *               of the goal; and the day the goal is reached.
 *
 * Read once a day per store by the hourly job that already looks for stopped
 * sales (app/api/cron/quiet), from the numbers the studio shows: the visits
 * kept by day, the sales and refunds on the creator's own Stripe account.
 *
 *   nl:alert:seen:<day>:<statsId>        looked at today
 *   nl:alert:<statsId>:<kind>[:<month>]  said this week, or this month
