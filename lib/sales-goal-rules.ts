 * $88 a day needed for the 20 days left" says what today has to do.
 *
 * Counted on the store's money as the numbers count it: paid sales and the
 * renewals of memberships and plans, before Stripe's fee and any refund, in
 * the store's currency, by the calendar month in UTC. Pure, so the panel, the
 * emails and the tests read it the same way; kept by lib/sales-goal.ts.
