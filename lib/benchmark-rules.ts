/**
 * How a store's numbers sit beside those of stores its size (added 13
 * October 2026). Pure, so the weekly sample, the daily ranges, the studio and
 * the tests read them the same way; kept by lib/benchmarks.ts.
 *
 * Read before it was built: Baremetrics' Benchmarks, ChartMogul's and
 * ProfitWell's, Triple Whale's and Polar's, and GA4's: a figure is set beside
 * the middle half of businesses like it, never beside a named one.
 *
 * Four rates, over the last 90 days, each one a store's own:
 *
 *   - visits that became a sale (sales / visitors);
 *   - checkouts that were paid (sales / checkouts);
 *   - sales refunded (refunds / sales);
 *   - buyers who had bought before (returning / buyers).
 *
 * Stores are put in a band by their visitors in those 90 days, so a store of
 * five hundred visits is set beside others of its size and not beside one of
 * fifty thousand. A store's rate is used only once its own counts are big
 * enough to mean something (MIN_VISITORS, MIN_SALES, MIN_BUYERS), and a band
 * shows a range only once MIN_STORES stores in it have that rate: below that
 * a range would say more about one store than about stores, and could let
 * someone guess at one. What is shown is the middle half (the 25th to the
 * 75th percentile) and the median, never a single store's figure.
