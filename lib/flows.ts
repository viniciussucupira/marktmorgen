/**
 * Automatic sequences: emails that go out by themselves, a set time after
 * somebody joins the list, gets one of the creator's products, or is given a
 * label by another sequence. A step can also act instead of writing: give a
 * label, take one off, or start another sequence (lib/flow-rules.ts,
 * FlowAction), which is how one sequence hands somebody to the next.
 *
 * Each person goes through a sequence once. Every step is checked again just
 * before it is sent — the person must still be on the list, the sequence
 * still switched on, the step still there — so an unsubscribe, a pause or an
 * edit takes effect on the next email, not the one after. A sequence can end
 * early for somebody once they buy, and an email can go only to some of the
 * people in it (lib/flow-rules.ts); both are read at that same moment.
 *
 * From 17 October 2026 a sequence is a workflow: a step can branch (IF/ELSE,
 * forward only, lib/flow-paths.ts), a step can only wait or make a teammate
 * responsible for a deal, a workflow can end when somebody gets a label, and
 * it can start when somebody opens a course or leaves a checkout they agreed
 * to hear about. Every run keeps its history (lib/flow-runs.ts): each step
 * attempted, confirmed, failed or uncertain, and an uncertain one holds the
 * run instead of being repeated. The numbers that bound all this are in
 * lib/flow-limits.ts: steps, workflows, active workflows and runs a day.
 * New workflows are saved paused; switching one on is its own action.
