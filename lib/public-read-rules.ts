 * map for search engines. Both read in proportion to the store (every
 * affiliate's sales, the whole catalog and blog), and until then neither
 * counted a single request, so a store's crawlers or its affiliates could
 * make it read without any ceiling.
 *
 * Each is sized first with cheap counts (field counts, a set's size, a
 * stored value's length, the store record it already has), then charged as
 * that many requests of the plan's window (lib/traffic.ts, takePublicRequest),
 * each priced as a later page (tests/traffic-cost.ts, laterPageCost); what
 * the counts allow it to read is bounded by them. Refused, nothing more is
 * read. The figures are held against what the reads cost in
 * tests/plan-cost-registry.test.ts.
 *
 * An affiliate program's book (lib/affiliates.ts, readBook) is worked out
 * for every affiliate at once and kept a day
 * (lib/affiliate-book-snapshot.ts): the load that finds it out of date pays
 * for working it out (affiliatePageUnits), every other load pays for
 * reading its own part (affiliateLoadUnits).
