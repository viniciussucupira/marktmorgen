/**
 * The products the studio's ready cart link builder offers (624 [SZ8](23),
 * components/cart-link-builder.tsx), read at a cost the studio admitted first.
 *
 * Codex G2 on #1928: the first version read every paid product's listing,
 * drafts included, before filtering them, so a store of 200 drafts and two
 * published products read 198 listings (about 320 kB) on a page admitted at
 * STUDIO_PAGE_UNITS. Now:
 *
 *   - the store record's index rules out, without a read, everything a cart
 *     can never take (free, a call, a membership, a limited one, a draft, one
 *     with price options), as offersCart does;
 *   - at most CART_LINK_CHOICES of what is left are read, in the store's
 *     order;
 *   - listings already in the store record (its head) cost nothing more; the
 *     others are weighed first from the data room (one HMGET, what each
 *     product's records weigh, the ceiling MAX_PRODUCT_BYTES when it is not
 *     known exactly) and paid for in studio requests at the studio request's
 *     shape (tests/plan-cost-registry.ts, line studio) before a single one is
 *     read. Refused, nothing is read and nothing is offered.
