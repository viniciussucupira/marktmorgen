/**
 * Free days given to one member (641 [WG1]; owner's Whop audit, "manage
 * users"): the creator puts off the next charge of one member's running
 * membership, as a courtesy or to make up for a problem. Everything happens
 * on the creator's own Stripe account (lib/stripe-account.ts, onAccount):
 * the membership's trial_end is set to its next charge plus the days, with no
 * proration (lib/member-free-days-rules.ts says why this and not a pause).
 * Marktmorgen takes nothing and charges nothing here. On a paid membership
 * the same request marks the new trial_end as free days, so nothing reads the
 * member as in a free trial (lib/member-free-days-rules.ts, freeDaysMarks).
 *
 * Read again on the server at the moment of giving, never taken from the
 * page: the member by their address, the membership among this store's
 * running ones of theirs (lib/member-discount.ts, memberSubRows), and its
 * next charge, which must be the one the creator was shown.
 *
 * Once, whatever the presses: a claim in Redis on the membership and the date
 * seen (SET NX, a day) lets one press through, and the Stripe call carries an
 * idempotency key from the membership, that date and the days. An answer from
 * Redis or Stripe that cannot be read is said as not known, and nothing is
 * recorded as done: no line in the activity log, no email. A date that has
 * moved since the creator saw it is refused, so a second press after the
 * first went through never adds the days again.
 *
 * Cost (MR): one studio request (the route's guard), the Stripe reads the
 * discount's own find makes and one write, all on the creator's account; two
 * Redis commands for the claim and the activity log's own two; and one email
 * to the member, taken from the store's own emails before it goes
 * (lib/email.ts, meter "store"/"email"), not sent when they are used up.
