/**
 * Scored quizzes (lib/forms.ts, added 17 October 2026). What is checked:
 *
 *   - a scored quiz is read safely: points whole from 0 to MAX_POINTS,
 *     categories only when they exist, a score range on every result; a form
 *     that is not scored reads exactly as it did before;
 *   - negative, fractional or too-large points are refused, not changed;
 *   - the total and each category's part are the points of the options
 *     chosen, on the questions a person's answers led through only;
 *   - with no scored question answered, nothing is measured: no result;
 *   - the ranges must cover every total from 0 to the highest possible
 *     exactly once: gaps, overlaps, equal ranges, a range that ends below its
 *     start, one nobody can reach and a quiz with no points are each found;
 *   - a total on a boundary belongs to the range that includes it, and on a
 *     tie the first result in the creator's order wins;
 *   - the result page shows only a score that could be true for its result;
 *   - the studio refuses to save a quiz whose ranges are wrong, and says why;
 *   - a funnel file carries a scored quiz whole, and refuses one whose ranges
 *     are wrong;
 *   - sent from a store's page, the total and categories are kept with the
 *     answers, shown on the result page's address, put in the spreadsheet,
 *     and kept from the browser.
