/**
 * Who an email to the list reaches is decided again at the moment each batch
 * goes (lib/broadcasts.ts advanceBroadcast, lib/mail.ts sendTo,
 * lib/contacts.ts tokensFor; ClickFunnels audit F25 and F27, added
 * 17 October 2026).
 *
 * A broadcast writes down its recipients when it starts, so a long send
 * neither skips anyone nor writes to anyone twice. That snapshot must never
 * outrank somebody's no: a send can outlive one run, a subject test holds
 * the rest of the list back for hours, and a scheduled email is listed long
 * before it goes. Checked here on one listed broadcast:
 *
 *   - an address that unsubscribed through the link after the list was
 *     written down is not written to;
 *   - nor one whose email bounced for good, or that marked an email as spam,
 *     since (the sender's notices, lib/contacts.ts stopWriting);
 *   - nor one that is no longer on the list at all;
 *   - everybody else is written to once, with an unsubscribe link and the
 *     one-click header, and the broadcast completes;
 *   - an unsubscribe that a lost write would undo stays: two unsubscribes
 *     and the send meeting on one contact never put the address back.
