/**
 * CX-123 rule 24, lot L10b: each signed Zoom notice is acted on once (app/api/integrations/zoom/deauthorize/route.ts),
 * under a ten-minute mark of its signature taken with SET NX, so a notice captured and sent again cannot disconnect an
 * account connected again since. A reply to that SET in any shape but "OK" or nil is read back: our own value is ours
 * and the notice is acted on; another value is a notice already handled; nothing readable (the database not answering
 * included, where before it carried on) acts on nothing and answers 503, letting go of a mark this request may have
 * written, so Zoom's retry is heard. A notice that failed lets go of its mark only while it still holds its own value.
