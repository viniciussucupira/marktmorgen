/**
 * Marktmorgen Path's rules (lib/path-rules.ts, 18 October 2026). What is
 * checked:
 *
 *   - every mission is read from facts only, and closes on its own fact;
 *   - the test purchase is open in test mode and unavailable live, and an
 *     unavailable day never holds the path back;
 *   - traffic missions follow the seven days when there is no sale, and go
 *     once a real sale is in;
 *   - levels by real money kept, in the store's currency's own scale, never
 *     going down: a refund takes the sale back, not the level;
 *   - the streak: Sunday never breaks it, two rest days a week are free, and
 *     today is never a missed day;
 *   - no notification between 21:00 and 08:00 in the person's own time;
 *   - the answers: bounded, cleaned, refused with a sentence.
