/**
 * The registry of what each module keeps about a store's people
 * (lib/person-data.ts) cannot fall behind the code (added 17 October 2026),
 * the way the cost registry cannot (tests/plan-cost-registry.test.ts):
 *
 *   - every file the scan finds keeping something per person
 *     (tests/person-data-scan.ts) has a line saying what becomes of it;
 *   - every line that says "erased" names a module lib/person-erasure.ts runs,
 *     and every module it runs has such a line;
 *   - each eraser it runs is a function its module exports;
 *   - every file named exists, and every "kept" line says why;
 *   - the privacy policy and the help say what the registry says, and send a
 *     deletion to the page that does it, not to an email address.
 *
 * So a module that begins to keep an address, a person's key or anything
 * made from them fails here until it says how that is deleted, or why not.
