/**
 * 273 [BK1]: the daily backup run (lib/backup-run.ts): export → seal → write
 * to the backup's own bucket → read back, the outcome kept for the report.
 * Against the in-memory database and a stand-in store; nothing real. Off three
 * ways today, each checked: no reviewed cost ceiling (BACKUP_COST_REVIEW is
 * null), no backup bucket settings, no encryption key. No schedule calls it.
 *
 * What fails here:
 *   - a run that sends a single command while any of the three is missing, or
 *     with a review that lacks its date, source, retention or storage ceiling,
 *     or whose ceiling the kept copies could pass;
 *   - a review read through a getter, inherited, or that throws when read;
 *   - more than a run and one new try after a failure in a day, or a call past
 *     them that sends more than the day's count;
 *   - a walk past its 200 SCAN pages taken as anything but its own failure;
 *   - a copy of its own older than the retention left after a run whose
 *     deletion finished; a failed deletion under the ceiling that costs the
 *     day's copy; a write that could take the bucket past the review's ceiling
 *     (retention + 2 sets), or one after a deletion at the ceiling that failed;
 *     the last verified copy deleted to make room; two runs at once;
 *   - a copy that does not read back the same counted as done;
 *   - a good copy's time lost to a later failure, a failure's reason not kept
 *     or kept without expiry, the last good copy's mark let expire, or a failed write of the outcome turned
 *     into an exception after a good copy;
 *   - a step that throws, instead of a result that says which;
 *   - the report saying no good copy while one is under 48 hours old, or
 *     silent when there is none.
