/**
 * The picture door and a sales page's claim read Redis only in the exact shape
 * of each reply (CX-123, rule 24; Revisor 1's review of #2657, 5 November 2026).
 *
 *   - takePictureDoor takes a note only when ZREM answered the whole number 1
 *     and ZSCORE a score (a number, or a numeric string as the REST API sends
 *     it); a ZREM of 0 and a ZSCORE of null are real answers (nothing taken).
 *     Any other answer (true, "1", [1], 2, an object, a word) throws, so its
 *     caller refuses before it writes; it is never read as "taken".
 *   - claimNewPictures refuses when an owner read by HMGET is neither a name
 *     nor null, instead of taking the picture for one nobody owns, and then
 *     leaves the picture's note on the door.
