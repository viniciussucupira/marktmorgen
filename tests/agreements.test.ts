/**
 * Proposals and agreements with an electronic signature (HighLevel audit H28;
 * lib/agreement-rules.ts, lib/agreement-store.ts, lib/agreements.ts, the two
 * routes; added 18 October 2026).
 *
 * Checked, in the in-memory Redis with the email sender mocked:
 *
 *   - what the studio sends is held to every rule, and the exact text is
 *     built once, the same way every time, with its SHA-256 fingerprint;
 *   - each record and each version takes its room in the store's data room
 *     before it is written, and the counts per person and per store hold;
 *   - a version's text is never changed: an edit is a new version that needs
 *     a new signature, the earlier signature stays recorded against the text
 *     it signed, and a text changed in storage is never shown or signed;
 *   - only the person it was sent to signs it: the address typed must be the
 *     one it went to, the version read must still be the latest, the consent
 *     box must be checked, the name must be a name, and a browser signed in
 *     to the store's studio is refused; it is signed once;
 *   - the record keeps the exact text, the fingerprint, the name, the time,
 *     the version and only an HMAC of the internet address, never the address;
 *   - both sides get the signed copy, with the text and an HTML file, each
 *     one of the store's emails for the month, and none when those are used;
 *   - withdrawing, deleting and deleting the person do what they say;
 *   - nothing says "legally binding", "court-admissible" or that anything
 *     complies with a law, and the privacy policy and terms say what is kept;
 *   - and the store commands each action sends, measured.
