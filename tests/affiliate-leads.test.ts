/**
 * Pay per lead (lib/affiliate-lead-rules.ts, lib/affiliate-leads.ts; added
 * 18 October 2026, HighLevel audit H29). Checked:
 *
 *   - the terms as kept, and refused out of range rather than replaced;
 *   - a sign-up credited only once confirmed and only for an address new to
 *     the list; a free product the first time; a booking carried on its
 *     checkout, never from a package;
 *   - one lead per person per program, written any way; never the
 *     affiliate's own address, their pay address or the creator's; never for
 *     an affiliate not approved, or a kind the program does not pay;
 *   - the daily cap, the hourly limit and the monthly budget, each lead
 *     judged by its own day's terms; a reversal frees its place;
 *   - the hold, then the creator's approval, before a lead is payable; a
 *     booking only after its call and never when refunded; reversals with a
 *     reason, and undone;
 *   - the book: leads beside sales, never a sale, a bonus or a second tier;
 *     held with everything else; in the spreadsheet;
 *   - erasure takes the address off the lead and keeps the fingerprint;
 *   - what it costs: a sign-up takes one of the store's public requests, and
 *     a lead's write stays inside a later page's commands.
