/**
 * The pricing and usage proposal of 18 October 2026
 * (docs/pricing-usage-proposal-2026-10-18.md): a PROPOSAL, no price, limit or
 * gate in code changes. The document must be what
 * tests/pricing-usage-proposal-table.ts renders today (regenerate it with
 * `node scripts/pricing-usage-proposal.mjs`), and every figure it proposes
 * must do what it says, under the repository's own margin code.
