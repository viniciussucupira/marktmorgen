/**
 * Marktmorgen Path read end to end from a store's own records (lib/path-facts.ts,
 * lib/path.ts, 18 October 2026), with synthetic records and Stripe played by
 * a stand-in for `fetch`: no real message, no live record. What is checked:
 *
 *   - each day closes on the record the store already keeps: its name and
 *     line, a product with a file, a paid checkout Stripe marks as test
 *     mode, a visit counted from a social network, three short links, an
 *     address left on the store, a real paid order;
 *   - a real order counts only when Stripe says it is complete, paid and in
 *     live mode, never a tip or a payment request; in test mode none can;
 *   - a refund in full takes the sale and its money back, while the level
 *     reached is kept; refunds Stripe could not list in full leave the money
 *     unknown and move no level;
 *   - the record: the answers kept, today counted once, written only when
 *     something changed, counted in the store's data room, and gone with
 *     the store.
