/**
 * CX-123 rules 24 and 30, lists from Stripe, lot 2 (lib/review-proof.ts):
 *
 *   - a membership bought through a subscription checkout is proved for a
 *     review from its first invoice's payment. A list of the invoice's
 *     payments read in another shape, or a failure to read it, was taken as
 *     "no payment", so the membership counted as not refunded and its review
 *     was let in. It is now not known: the proof says "error" (a 404 is
 *     still "no");
 *   - the pass that marks reviews of refunded orders read a refunds page in
 *     another shape, or with a row not readable, as the last page, and moved
 *     its anchor past refunds it never read. It now keeps the anchor.
