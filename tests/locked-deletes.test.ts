/**
 * A session let in without its second step (lib/two-step.ts enterLocked: the
 * person who only has the creator's old inbox) may not delete anything for
 * good, nor email every member, until two-step login turns off (4 November
 * 2026, C2-76, after a review found the same harm through doors other than
 * erasing a person or removing a product). Each check below sends the real
 * route a request with a real locked session (openLockedSession) and the
 * creator's own store, and reads that it was refused before anything went:
 *
 *   - the community: an announcement emailed to every member, a post or a
 *     comment deleted, the chat room emptied or a message taken out, a
 *     reported post deleted, and a lesson comment deleted from the course;
 *   - the course: a lesson, a module, a lesson file, an assignment with the
 *     work handed in, a quiz, a student's certificate, a lesson comment, and a
 *     new video over the old one;
 *   - a waitlist launched (one email, in the creator's words, to everyone on
 *     it), a link put over a product's file, and the store's own fields saved
 *     without one (its answers go off every person);
 *   - the product's file taken off or replaced, and a price option's own
 *     file the same way (by the option's id), its picture removed or
 *     replaced, a page saved without a picture it showed, license keys and a
 *     bundle cleared, a price option, an episode, a page funnel, captions;
 *   - the store's pages: a form with its answers, a site page and its
 *     pictures, a saved block, a link and its picture, a short link, a blog
 *     post, the store photo, the missed questions, a link turned into a
 *     heading (its picture goes);
 *   - events canceled, deleted or moved (each emails everyone coming);
 *   - notes, tasks, deals, pitches, segments and drafts deleted, a buyer's
 *     review photo taken off;
 *   - no passkey request from a locked session, not even a list, spends the
 *     owner's hourly changes; a removal only waits (lib/passkeys.ts
 *     scheduleRemoval), on a count of its own.
 *
 * Where a route deletes a file, the check also reads the file back after the
 * refusal, and the inventory holds every such route to one of those reads.
 *
 * And what has a way back stays open: adding and editing, a post that emails
 * nobody, an event edited without moving it.
 *
 * The inventory at the end reads every route under app/api/store that
 * deletes or sends, and holds each to a way it is kept from a locked session,
 * or to a reason it is not the creator's store being deleted; and every
 * action such a route names to one of those, or to why it stays open, so a
 * new action fails here until somebody says which it is.
