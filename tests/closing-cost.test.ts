/**
 * What a store's closing costs (added 18 October 2026), held to the owner's
 * rule: per customer, inside that customer's own margin. A closing is part
 * of one store's life, so its worst cost is priced once for each store and
 * charged against each of its payments (tests/plan-cost-registry.ts,
 * PER_PAYMENT_LINES, closure), and tests/spend-floor.test.ts holds every
 * plan, by the month and by the year, to the floor with its buffer with it
 * counted: a store that paid one month and closed carries all of it.
 *
 * What is held here:
 *
 *   - the closure's parts are finite, and the line is in the payments' sum;
 *   - what a unit writes, which goes by itself, is paid for to its end by
 *     the window that wrote it (partAverage at least lifetimeByteMonths), so
 *     neither what it leaves after a plan ends nor after the closing day is
 *     counted again;
 *   - a buyer's library entry is priced with its order for its whole life,
 *     the quarters it is kept, and runs out by itself (CLOSING, lapses);
 *   - the export a paying store takes from its studio figure costs no more
 *     than the units it takes, Stripe's pages included;
 *   - the walk, reading the whole database, is the company's scheduled job.
