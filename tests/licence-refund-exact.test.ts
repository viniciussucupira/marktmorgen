/**
 * License keys read Redis and Stripe only in their exact shape (CX-123 rules 24 and 30; sweep A3 finding 2 and its
 * siblings, docs/reviews/c5-sweep-a3.md). Synthetic only: the in-memory Redis double and a stand-in for the
 * creator's Stripe account.
 *
 * A refund is marked read only once the key it takes back is revoked for sure. An answer of unknown shape (Redis
 * replying something that is not a key nor "none", Stripe answering a list without its `data` array) is not "this
 * sale has no key" nor "no checkout": the refund stays unread and the next run revokes the key. The same file's
 * low-pool warning, pool cap and data copy treat an unknown count or list as unknown, never as zero or empty.
 *
 * Review MEDIUM on #2868: a product the store still lists whose listing read comes back empty (a product outside the
 * catalog head, its GET answered in an unknown shape) is not "the product is gone": the refund stays unread and the
 * next run revokes the key.
 *
 * Review MEDIUM on #2868 (Codex G): a key's record read back as text that is not JSON, or as JSON of another shape,
 * is not "this product never gave the key": the refund stays unread, the healthy record is not overwritten, and the
 * next run revokes the key. The data copy says such a record is unknown rather than leave the key out.
