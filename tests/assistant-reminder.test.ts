/**
 * The Store assistant's third function: one reminder after a checkout left
 * unpaid, only to a buyer who checked its box at checkout
 * (lib/assistant-reminder.ts, lib/assistant-reminder-rules.ts, added 17
 * October 2026). Stripe, the model and the sender are played by a stand-in
 * for `fetch`. What is checked:
 *
 *   - off until the creator switches it on, the add-on is paid for and a
 *     postal address is given; no box, no yes kept, nothing sent;
 *   - the yes is kept only with the box checked, a valid address and the
 *     sentence's current version, word for word, with when; never an address
 *     in the queue; gone by itself in three days, and at once with the person;
 *   - no email without the box (Stripe's own consent path leaves a checked
 *     checkout to this one), after the checkout was paid, after the address
 *     paid elsewhere, twice for one checkout, after "stop", or with no
 *     postal address;
 *   - the email: the creator's name, postal address, the sentence checked and
 *     the day, a stop link and one-click header, an honest subject, and the
 *     AI's line under its label only when it holds; the fixed reminder when
 *     the line does not hold, the model fails or the month's replies are used;
 *   - one reply of the month's pool, at no more than a chat reply's worst,
 *     settled at what was billed; the store's email figure checked before the
 *     model is asked; the add-on still keeps the owner's floor;
 *   - the pages, the policies and the registry say so.
