/**
 * Limited products in the cart (513 [PF1], unit 3; lib/stock.ts
 * withCartStockHolds, confirmCartStock, releaseCartStockHolds; added 2
 * November 2026). Checked, with Redis stubbed and Stripe mocked:
 *
 *   - a limited product goes in a cart, and a store with two offers one;
 *   - a cart's checkout holds one unit of each limited product, writes each
 *     hold, and is told so, so it closes before the hold runs out;
 *   - with any of them sold out, nothing opens and the sold out ones are
 *     named; a lock another checkout holds, a lock lost while Stripe was
 *     asked, or a count that cannot be read, opens nothing; a checkout that
 *     fails to open holds nothing and lets every lock go; a checkout whose
 *     hold cannot be written is closed at Stripe; a provisional hold that
 *     lapsed is let go without asking Stripe;
 *   - a cart of unlimited products takes no lock and holds nothing;
 *   - going back from Stripe and paying again closes the old checkout first
 *     and hands its units back; a paid one is never handed back, nor one
 *     Stripe will not close because it was just paid;
 *   - the thanks page marks each limited product of the cart sold;
 *   - the open cart says a sold out one is sold out and leaves it out of the
 *     total, and never says so of one whose count cannot be read; the route
 *     sends a cart that sold out back to it, and sets the cookie that hands
 *     its units back;
 *   - the store page, the product page, "Goes well with" and the cart's
 *     reminder leave a sold out one out (read in their source).
