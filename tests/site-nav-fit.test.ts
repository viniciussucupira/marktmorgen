/**
 * The "Product" menu, whole on one screen (524 [NV1]; added 1 November 2026).
 *
 * Measured in Chromium against a production build on 1 November 2026: before,
 * the panel's links needed 769 px and showed 541 at 1536 × 639 (622 at
 * 1280 × 720), scrolling inside itself with seven links out of sight, and
 * its cap let it end 15 px below a 720 px window. After, 469 px, no scroll
 * and no link out of sight at 1280 × 720, 1366 × 720 and 1536 × 639. The
 * browser measurement is not repeated here; what holds it in place is:
 *
 *   - every item keeps its place: the same three groups, twenty pages, their
 *     icons, the panel on the left and its link to every feature;
 *   - each phrase is one short line: none longer than the longest measured
 *     on one line at 14 px (34 characters), and each name fits too;
 *   - the rows keep a 44 px target and the panel's cap is the window less
 *     the header, so it never ends below the window;
 *   - the menus still open with real buttons, aria-expanded and aria-controls.
