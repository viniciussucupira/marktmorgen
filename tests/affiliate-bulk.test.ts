/**
 * 630 [HN6](4), unit 1: several applications approved or declined at once,

 * lib/affiliates.ts decideMany/undoMany. Only pending applications are
 * touched; the undo puts back exactly those still as the press left them,
 * within ten minutes, never one decided by hand since and never anything
 * that was not pending; the studio offers it with words.
