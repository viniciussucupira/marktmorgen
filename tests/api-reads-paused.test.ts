/**
 * 232 [CA1] unit 4b4c: while a store's plan renewal is unpaid, or a payment
 * for its plan is disputed, reading the store through one of its API keys
 * (the REST API's reads and every MCP tool) is refused with its sentence
 * before any of the month's API requests is taken or anything outside is
 * reached; taking back access and removing a webhook endpoint through the
 * API stay open, and reads work again once paid (lib/api-guard.ts).
