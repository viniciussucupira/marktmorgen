/**
 * The affiliate directory (lib/affiliate-directory.ts, opened 11 October
 * 2026). What is checked:
 *
 *   - a program is listed only when its creator said yes, it is on with a
 *     share, the store can take a card today and something earns;
 *   - the demo store never, whatever it says;
 *   - each product says what one sale earns at today's price, at its own
 *     share; memberships, payment plans, drafts, free things and products
 *     left out at 0% are not shown as earning;
 *   - the order is the one written on the page;
 *   - unchecking the box takes the program off the page at once.
