 * A PROPOSAL, not a change (18 October 2026), superseded the same day at
 * 11:21 by the owner's decision to set prices instead (lib/plan.ts): at the
 * price list every plan keeps 60% at today's limits, so no cut is proposed

 * that would; and the AI captions price that would. No figure in code is
 * changed by any of this: every "today" figure below is read from the
