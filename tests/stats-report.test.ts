/**
 * The second half of the numbers added on 11 October 2026: countries and
 * devices, each channel from visit to sale, the API's summary and the weekly
 * email (lib/stats.ts, lib/source-rules.ts, lib/stats-report.ts). What is
 * checked:
 *
 *   - a device and a country are read from what the browser and the host say;
 *   - a view counts its country and device, a checkout its channel, a free
 *     product's address its channel too, and each window reads them back;
 *   - a channel's visits, checkouts, signups and sales sit on one row;
 *   - the API's summary keeps money null when Stripe was not read;
 *   - the weekly email says nothing when there was nobody, is claimed once a
 *     week, and its stop link only works for the store it was made for.
