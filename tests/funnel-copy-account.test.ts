/**
 * Copying a funnel into another store of the same account (app/api/store/
 * funnel-share, "copy-preview" and "copy"; lib/funnel-bundle.ts, mode
 * "account"; added 18 October 2026, ClickFunnels audit row F05), end to end
 * through the route against the in-memory Redis:
 *
 *   - only the account's owner may copy, only between its own stores: a
 *     teammate with every page and product permission, and a store of
 *     anyone else, are refused;
 *   - the preview writes nothing in either store and reports what the copy
 *     would need there and leave out;
 *   - the copy keeps the creator's own words (the about text, the videos,
 *     the deadline, what was said about them elsewhere), maps the funnel's
 *     products to the other store's, and arrives as a draft;
 *   - no product id, store id or payment id of the first store comes
 *     across (pictures never do: tests/funnel-share.test.ts);
 *   - it is counted as an export of the first store and an import of the
 *     other, so it is inside both plans' priced monthly figures.
