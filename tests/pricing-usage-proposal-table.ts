/**
 * A PROPOSAL, not a change (18 October 2026): a HighLevel-style price list
 * for Marktmorgen. Each plan at an entry price near the competitor plan a
 * buyer will set it beside, a smaller INCLUDED amount of the resources that
 * cost money per use, and everything above it sold in prepaid packs, each
 * pack keeping 60% on its own after every fee and tax. No price, limit or
 * gate in code is changed by any of this, and nothing opens a sale.
 *
 * Nothing here is margin arithmetic of its own. Every net, floor and room is
 * lib/receiving-costs.ts (unitUnder, the sizing reading and the most-tax
 * reading); a plan's usage at full use is tests/limits-proposal-table.ts
 * (usageCents, figures, tidy), which reads tests/plan-cost-registry.ts; the
 * lowest price that keeps 60% is tests/margin-alignment-table.ts
 * (floorPriceCents, roomKept); a pack's unit costs are the registry's own
 * (visitCost, ORDER_COST, PER_EMAIL, UNIT_COST, hourCost, STORAGE_PER_GB)
 * and the AI cost table's (WRITING_JOB_MICRO_USD, ANSWER_MICRO_USD). This
 * file only chooses: which prices to look at, which sizes a pack comes in,
 * and the rule for the recommended point, all stated in the document.
 *
