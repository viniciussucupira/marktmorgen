/**
 * More feature-page cards (531 [VP1], units 2 and 3; added 1 November 2026):
 * bundles, quizzes and certificates, license keys, webhooks, calendar sync,
 * Discord access (units 2 and 3), the community and affiliates (unit 4),
 * the team and email platforms (unit 6), PDF stamping and ways to pay
 * (unit 7), phone notifications (unit 8), live events (unit 5; the reviews page has none, since a drawn review would
 * be an invented one),
 * each a piece of the
 * studio's real screen in HTML, with its words and figures from the code.
 * Checked: each page shows its card; the studio's own labels; every figure
 * is one the code holds (the bundle's 2 to 20, the quiz's default pass mark
 * and tries, a key's default shape), and anything else is marked as an
 * example by its caption; real text, the drawing hidden beside its read
 * caption.
