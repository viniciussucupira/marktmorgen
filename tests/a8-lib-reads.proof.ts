/**
 * A8 proof (CX-123 rule 24), lib readers the buyer pages of app/[handle] call
 * directly: each one answers a reply out of shape with the same value it gives
 * for an absent key, so the page cannot tell "nothing there" from "not known"
 * and draws the first. Every check states the honest outcome (the reader
 * throws), so each FAILS on main today. LEVE: what follows on the pages is a
 * wrong display (no rating, no reviews, no search hits in the room, a form's
 * "done" page answered 404, the "where did you hear about us" question asked
 * of a store that turned it off, a coming-soon product's booking page open),
 * with no write, access or money decided by it in app/[handle].
 *
 * Synthetic store; one reply injected per reader; no network.
