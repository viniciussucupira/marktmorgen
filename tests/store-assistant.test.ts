/**
 * The Store assistant add-on (lib/store-assistant.ts, added 17 October 2026).
 * The model is played by a stand-in for `fetch`, which records what it was
 * sent and answers what each part asks it to, including a model that obeys
 * a buyer's attempt to change its rules. What is checked:
 *
 *   - off until the creator switches it on AND the add-on is paid for;
 *   - every reply carries the AI label, set by the server, not the model;
 *   - it answers only from the store's published facts, and a reply that
 *     names a figure, a deal, a code or a link not in them is never shown,
 *     whatever the model was told or tricked into (prompt injection);
 *   - complaints, refunds and requests for a person go to the creator with
 *     no model asked; a question handed over lands in the inbox;
 *   - the month's pool is reserved at the worst cost before each call,
 *     settled at what the model billed, given back when nothing was billed,
 *     kept when a timeout may have been billed, and closed when spent;
 *   - what is kept about a buyer: the conversation for a day, by a token,
 *     with no address, deletable at once;
 *   - the add-on alone, every reply used, keeps 60% after the 27.5% tax with
 *     the dearer fee, remittance and reserves; under the most-tax reading it
 *     does not, and it is not on sale;
 *   - the public pages state the code's own numbers.
