/**
 * The questions someone starting out asks about paid calls (534 [FQ1], unit

 * seats; the studio's Upcoming calls and its own sentence about Stripe; the
 * reminders as they are planned; the shared trial answer; no figure about
 * calls or bookings; first in the page's own Questions block, no question
 * asked twice.
