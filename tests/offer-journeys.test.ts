/**
 * The three ways a buyer adds a product to an order, walked from end to end
 * against a stand-in Stripe (F11 order bumps, F12 offers after paying and
 * their downsells, F13 the cart; 17 October 2026). Every Stripe answer here
 * is synthetic and nothing real is reached. What is checked, for each path:
 *
 *   - explicit opt-in: nothing is added that the buyer did not choose. A box
 *     is never checked for them; an offer after paying is charged only on
 *     its own "yes", only for the offer they are at, only in the browser that
 *     paid, once however often it is pressed; "no thanks" leads to the
 *     cheaper offer and charges nothing;
 *   - the price shown is the price charged: each line at the creator's price
 *     for it, a store's sale taken off once (by Stripe's coupon on a checkout,
 *     already in the line on a cart, never both), an offer after paying at
 *     exactly its own price;
 *   - discounts do not stack: one coupon or the code box, never both, and no
 *     code box once something was taken off;
 *   - currency: every line in the store's currency, and no offer after paying
 *     an order in another; none while sales tax is on;
 *   - a refund in full closes everything the order handed over, bumps and a
 *     bundle's contents with it, and takes back the share and the affiliate's
 *     commission; a partial refund takes back only its part;
 *   - an affiliate credited by a code typed at checkout earns each product's
 *     own share of a bump: the defect this file was written with (the bump's
 *     amount was only written when the buyer came through a link).
