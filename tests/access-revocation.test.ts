/**
 * What a refund or an ended membership takes back, at the doors a course and
 * a community open (lib/refunds.ts, lib/learn.ts paidCourses,
 * lib/community-access.ts paidForAny; ClickFunnels audit F34–F39, added
 * 17 October 2026).
 *
 * lib/refunds.ts is the one rule every door uses, and it had no test of its
 * own. Checked here, against a stand-in for the creator's Stripe account:
 *
 *   - refunded in full is what Stripe says on the charge: its flag, or every
 *     cent given back; a partial refund keeps access; anything Stripe did not
 *     expand counts as not refunded;
 *   - a payment plan is judged by its first invoice's payment, whichever way
 *     the account's API version names it;
 *   - a course bought once opens, and closes when refunded in full, even
 *     though the thanks page wrote it down; bought again after the refund, it
 *     opens again; one the creator took the student off stays shut;
 *   - a course sold as a membership opens while Stripe calls it active,
 *     trialing or past due (the retry grace) and is "ended" once canceled or
 *     unpaid;
 *   - a community opens for a paid, unrefunded purchase or a running
 *     membership, and for an offer added in one click after paying only while
 *     that payment stands;
 *   - when Stripe cannot be asked, nobody is let into the community on a guess.
