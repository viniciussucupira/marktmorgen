/**
 * The Vercel Blob operations of the doors outside the studio's own pictures (MR audit unit (b), approved by Claude 4,
 * C4-20261106-2790-C56-167), each counted in the line whose figure bounds it, at the official prices read on
 * 6 November 2026 (vercel.com/docs/vercel-blob/usage-and-pricing): a put or a signed token is an Advanced Operation,
 * US$ 5 a million; a head or a read is a Simple Operation, US$ 0.40 a million; every SDK request (put, head, token) up
 * to 11 tries; a get is one plain fetch; a delete is free; a read is counted with its whole bytes.
 *
 *   1. A community picture: its door (a signed token, the browser's put) and its check when a post uses it (a head, a
 *      read of its first bytes). A buyer's door or post takes one of the store's buyer actions; the creator's take
 *      studio requests, already priced inside studio-blob at the dearest studio request.
 *   2. A student's file: its door (a signed token, the browser's put) and its hand-in (a head). Each takes a buyer
 *      action.
 *   3. An email's picture: a put from the server, one of the store's calls to connected services (the integration
 *      figure), and nothing else: no token, no head, no read.
 *
 * Unknown is never zero: a store that pays nothing (a trial) does the same with its own figures, carried by the
 * paying stores' share (nonPayingWorst).
