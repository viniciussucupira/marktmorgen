/**
 * The plan refund route and the words around it (305 [SY1] unit 2b2:
 * app/api/billing/refund/route.ts, lib/plan-refund-words.ts, the email in
 * lib/plan-refund-flow.ts), against the stand-in Stripe and Resend of
 * tests/plan-refund-stripe-world.ts. The signed-in creator is set by the
 * test (tests/plan-refund-route-world.ts). Nothing real is reached.
 *
 * What fails here:
 *   - a refund made without the review page's one-time pass, with a pass
 *     used before, by someone who is not the store's owner, or for another
 *     amount than the page showed;
 *   - no confirmation email, two of them, or one whose amount or words do
 *     not match what was done;
 *   - a refusal without a reason in plain words and the way to support.
