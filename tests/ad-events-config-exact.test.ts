/**
 * The sealed setup of server-sent conversions (lib/ad-events.ts) is read
 * exactly before anything is written over it (CX-123 rule 24):
 *
 *   - setServerToken and setTestCode read the setup, change one field and
 *     write it all back. A reply that is not nil and not a JSON object of
 *     strings (cut short, not JSON, a list, a number) is unknown: they refuse
 *     and write nothing, so the other platforms' tokens and Pinterest's ad
 *     account are never wiped by a guess. Nil (nothing kept yet) stays a
 *     fresh, empty setup;
 *   - serverSetup reads the same way, `last` included (a JSON object other
 *     than { at, kind?, ...answers } is unknown), and the route
 *     (app/api/store/ads-server) answers 503 "unavailable" and writes neither
 *     the setup nor the store's own list of platforms when it cannot read it
 *     before a change; when only the read back after a change fails, it
 *     answers 503 "saved_unread" and the editor says the change was saved;
 *   - the studio shows that the setup could not be read rather than an empty
 *     one (and does not write an empty list on the store from it);
 *   - customerType: a Stripe list without its `data` list is unknown (null),
 *     never a "new" customer.
