/**
 * What customers are saying (lib/customer-voice.ts; added 12 October 2026).
 * Checked:
 *
 *   - the four lists are read together, from the last 90 days, without names,
 *     with addresses, phone numbers and links taken out;
 *   - the model only sorts: a number it was not handed, a text already in a
 *     theme, a theme of one text and a name with a figure are dropped; counts
 *     and examples come from the texts themselves;
 *   - made only with enough to read, once a calendar month, as one of the
 *     month's AI jobs, and given back unchanged after that.
