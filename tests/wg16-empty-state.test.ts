/**
 * 656 [WG16], unit 1: one pattern for an empty list (components/empty-state.tsx):
 * a heading, one sentence and, only where it works, one action. On the public
 * store it speaks to the buyer and draws no dead button: the store with nothing
 * on it and its blog with no posts each say what this is and what comes, in
 * every buyer language. A store with no posts has no blog at all (its page is
 * not found, and nothing links to it); the blog's empty state is a page past
 * the last post, with a link to all posts. The studio is unit 2 (app/studio/page.tsx is held by
 * other work); the buyer's orders and library wait on #1969, which rewrites
 * those parts.
