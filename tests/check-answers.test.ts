/**
 * Before an email goes to people, a summary with "Change" on each item
 * (487 [IT4], pattern 8, GOV.UK "Check answers"; added 1 November 2026;
 * components/email-studio.tsx). Checked:
 *
 *   - the review is a summary list: the subject, who gets it and when, each
 *     as a term and its answer, never one sentence to parse;
 *   - each row has a "Change" button whose name says what it changes, and it
 *     closes the review and puts the focus on that field;
 *   - the fields it leads to have the ids it names;
 *   - the review still says the audience is checked again when sending starts,
 *     and the send button still names how many people.
