/**
 * Gifts and purchases for several when a write LANDED but its reply came back in another shape (#2872 reviews:
 * Claude 4 M1 and L1, Claude 4 focal rule-30 LEVE, Claude 1 N1), synthetic only: the in-memory Redis double and an
 * email stand-in; no Stripe, no real email. Each part beside its healthy control:
 *
 * A/B. M1: the last write (the gift marked given, the purchase marked paid) lands with an unknown reply. The run
 *      throws (rule 24), and the next run must still send the emails that come after that write (the friend's, the
 *      payer's receipt, the receipt with the link that hands out the places), once, never "already" with nothing sent.
 * C.   L1: the places counter's INCR lands with an unknown reply. Two places paid for: two people hold the product,
 *      the link page does not say "full" to the second, and never a place more than paid.
 * D.   Rule 30: an address holding a leftover record of a place without the product is never emailed "You already
 *      took your place"; on a full purchase it is told "full", as takePlace says.
 * E.   N1: the grant of a place answers in another shape. Not landed: the place is given back and the link works
 *      again; landed: the place is taken. Two places paid for: two people hold the product.
 * F.   N2 (Claude 1 on #2872): a give-back's two commands run one at a time, and a second taker past the places paid
 *      for runs its whole take (and the count heal) between them. No reply is altered. Two places paid for: the count
 *      stays at two, a later address is told full, and only two people hold the product.
