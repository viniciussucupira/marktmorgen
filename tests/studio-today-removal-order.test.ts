/**
 * 651 [WG11] unit 2, on Today (app/studio/page.tsx): the person's passkeys, and whether this session may add or keep
 * one, are read only after the passkeys whose wait has run out are removed (lib/passkeys.ts pendingRemoval), as before
 * the page sent its reads together. Read beside that removal, the list still held the passkey being removed, and the
 * studio showed a passkey that could no longer log in, with no removal date beside it.
 *
 * The real page, a real store and a real passkey set to be removed seven days and a minute ago (its removal record
 * written as lib/passkeys.ts writes one whose notice went out). What Today hands its passkey managers must not hold that passkey.
 *
 * And the store writes Today's parts make, in the order they had when the page read one section after another (#2900):
 * the ready cart link's count, which reads the billing month from Stripe and writes it when it is not known
 * (lib/billing-sync.ts refreshPeriod, under the store's lock), then a token's platforms (setAdsServer), then the
 * add-on's month (syncAssistant). Rendered side by side, the cart link's write met the others on the store's lock.
 *
 * And the banner over Today about two-step login (Claude 4's C4-2980 on #2900): when the person's two-step login could
 * not be read, the page says so plainly, rather than reading it as "no request to turn it off" and showing nothing.
 * Nor does Two-step login below, or the invitation to add an app's code, take that unread login for "off": they offer
 * no way to turn it on over it, and say it could not be read (CX-123 rule 24, lib/redis-reply.ts).
 *
 * And "Update now" (Claude 5's LEVE 1 on #2835): the day's reading of the store's numbers is taken only once the
 * reads the page waits for have answered, never for a page that ends in its error. Nor does the one read made after
 * it, the products the numbers name (Claude 5's residual LEVE on #2835), end the page in its error once the reading
 * is spent: the numbers then wait, as when they could not be read, and no product is named gone for it.
