/**
 * Sequences read Redis replies only in their exact shape (CX-123 rules 24/30; sweep A2 findings 6 and 7,
 * docs/reviews/c5-sweep-a2.md on claude5/sweep-a2). Synthetic store, the in-memory Redis double and a stand-in
 * email provider.
 *
 * 1. lib/flows.ts startFlows: the SET NX that makes "each person goes through a sequence once" is claimed only on
 *    exactly "OK", not claimed on exactly nil, and unknown on anything else: an unknown reply never restarts a run
 *    (its record and history kept) and never sends the first email again.
 * 2. lib/flows.ts sendDueSteps: an unknown read of the store's workflows leaves the due batch queued for a later run,
 *    never dropped; once Redis answers again, the step is sent.
 * 3. lib/flow-runs.ts siblings: readRun and runPeople throw on an unknown slot rather than answering "no such run" or
 *    "this run holds no address".
 * 4. sendDueSteps: a workflows reply that is a string but not a JSON list is unknown too, never "no workflows".
 * 5. readRun and listRuns: an HGETALL list of odd length (or, in listRuns, of another shape) is unknown, never
 *    "no such run" or a run left out of the list.
