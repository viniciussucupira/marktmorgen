/**
 * 568 [GD2] (h): every action that cannot be undone asks first (WCAG 3.3.4, 3.3.6
 * at AAA). The audit of 1 November 2026 found four that did not: deleting a blog
 * post, deleting an agreement, removing the license keys not yet given and
 * removing a webhook endpoint. Each now goes through ConfirmAction
 * (components/confirm-action.tsx): the first press asks what will happen; only
 * "Yes, …" does it; "Keep it", focused, puts it back.
 *
 * What fails here: one of the four acting on its first press again; the
 * component doing it without the second press, or without saying what happens.
