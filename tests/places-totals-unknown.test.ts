/**
 * Places and member totals read only in their exact shape (sweep app5, findings 1-3; CX-123 rules 24 and 30; VR item
 * 2). Synthetic only: the in-memory Redis double, a Stripe stand-in that fails, no network.
 *
 * 1. A purchase for several (app/[handle]/group/[group]/page.tsx, lib/group-buy.ts placesTaken): a count Redis
 *    answered in another shape, or could not answer, is unknown, never "nobody took a place". The page says the
 *    places could not be checked and offers no form; a full purchase is never shown as all places open.
 * 2. A community event (lib/community-events.ts rsvpNumbers and rsvp; the event page and the events list): an
 *    unknown count is never "0 going" with places left and the RSVP form; a member's own place is read on its own,
 *    so an unknown count never hides it nor withholds the way in; an unknown place is never "not going"; taking a
 *    place with an unknown answer fails and never leaves somebody over the cap.
 * 3. All your stores (app/studio/totals/page.tsx, lib/account-totals.ts): a store whose members could not be read
 *    is named, and the member figures say they are short (or not known), never a partial sum or $0 as the whole.
 *
 * Healthy controls first in each part.
