/**
 * 232 [CA1] unit 4: a renewal Stripe could not collect stops what costs us
 * to run from the first day it is seen, without ending the plan.
 *
 *   - Stripe's `past_due` (in its grace) is read as an active plan with its
 *     renewal unpaid; the first payment after a trial stays "inactive";
 *   - the store's record dates it once, keeps the date while it stays
 *     unpaid, clears it when paid, when the plan stops or for another
 *     subscription; the plan is not ended, not put in line for closing, and
 *     the store leaves the list of stores that pay;
 *   - checkout, free copies, sign-ups (isPaidUp), emails to the list
 *     (canUse "email"), AI drafts, AI spending, uploads and lesson video
 *     (costStandingOf) stop; the studio's own figure, the store's domain and
 *     look and its billing window do not;
 *   - the reminders job writes it down before its email says so, and a
 *     failure to write it keeps the email for the next run;
 *   - the studio shows Stripe's own page that pays the open invoice, read
 *     fresh, and says what stopped and what did not; the email and the Terms
 *     say the same words.
