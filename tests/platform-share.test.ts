/**
 * The share of each sale (lib/platform-share.ts) and the daily job that keeps
 * what was taken to what is owed (lib/share-settle.ts), built on October 12,
 * 2026 ahead of the switch that turns it on. Run with the switch passed in as
 * on, against a stand-in for Stripe. What is checked:
 *
 *   - who owes a share, and how much: by plan, never in the free trial, never
 *     for a store that subscribed before the share, never once a plan ends;
 *   - the fee set on a checkout is the share of the least the buyer can pay,
 *     so it can never be more than the payment, and a membership carries the
 *     plan's percentage;
 *   - the job gives back the part of a fee above the share of what was paid
 *     after a discount and the tax, the share of a refund, all of it after a
 *     lost dispute and all of it on a payment made inside the trial; it never
 *     raises a fee, and running it twice gives back nothing twice;
 *   - a store's memberships are moved to its plan's percentage when it changes.
