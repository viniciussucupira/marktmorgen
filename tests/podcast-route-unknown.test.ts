/**
 * A podcast record read in an unknown shape is never taken for an empty podcast (CX-123 rule 24; sweep APP3, finding 2).
 *
 * app/api/store/podcast/route.ts read `(await readPodcast(id)) ?? { id, episodes: [] }`, and readPodcast answered null
 * both for a podcast with no record and for a GET of nl:pod:<id> that came back with no reply, a number or text that is
 * not a podcast. Under the lock the route then wrote the podcast back whole: an upload left the private feed with only
 * the new episode, and "disable" deleted a podcast that had episodes. Now readPodcast answers null only for Redis's
 * exact null and throws UnknownReplyError for anything else, and the route answers 503 "unavailable" and writes nothing.
 *
 * Synthetic only: the in-memory Redis double, and a local stand-in for Vercel Blob's HEAD answering for the upload.
