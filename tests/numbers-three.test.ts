/**
 * The third part of the numbers added on 11 October 2026: a link for one
 * post and what that post brought, who is on the store right now, free
 * sign-ups by channel, the busy-day email and the MCP server
 * (lib/share-links.ts, lib/stats.ts, lib/stats-report.ts, app/api/mcp). What
 * is checked:
 *
 *   - a post's link carries where it went and the post's own name, and an
 *     unknown place is "other", never a word somebody typed;
 *   - each post's row joins its visits to its sales, money first;
 *   - "right now" counts each person once, under where they last came from,
 *     forgets anybody older than five minutes and lets go of the stale;
 *   - an address left in a sign-up box is counted under its channel;
 *   - a busy day is busy against the store's own usual, never against a
 *     quiet fortnight's single visit, and the email goes once a day, only to
 *     a store with a plan running whose creator has not stopped the emails;
 *   - the MCP server tells a client what it is without a key, reads nothing
 *     without one, reads its own store's numbers with one, and lists no
 *     buyer's address among its tools.
