/**
 * 290 [SQ1]: a student's private notes on each lesson (lib/lesson-notes.ts).
 *
 * What must hold, and what this file proves with the real code on the
 * in-memory Redis:
 *
 *   only the owner reads   notes are kept under the student's own key, read
 *                          only through the session (courseAccess), never
 *                          from anything the browser sends; the creator and
 *                          other students never see them;
 *   caps                   a note's size and the number of notes one student
 *                          keeps are checked before anything is written, and
 *                          what is kept takes room in the store's data room;
 *   erasure                deleting the person deletes every note and gives
 *                          the room back; an unknown reply deletes nothing
 *                          and is reported, never taken for "none";
 *   copy                   the person's data copy holds their notes;
 *   unknown never          a note that cannot be read is shown as "could not
 *   overwrites             be loaded", never as an empty box, and a save is
 *                          refused unless it starts from what is kept now.
