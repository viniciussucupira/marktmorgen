/**
 * The optional rules of a discount code, kept by Stripe (554 [DS1], unit 1;
 * added 1 November 2026). Checked against a stand-in for the creator's
 * Stripe account at the pinned API version:
 *
 *   - a minimum order is written as the promotion code's own restriction
 *     (restrictions[minimum_amount] and restrictions[minimum_amount_currency],
 *     docs.stripe.com/api/promotion_codes/create, read 1 November 2026), in the
 *     store's currency, and nothing else is worked out here;
 *   - a code with no minimum is sent exactly as before, and the coupon is
 *     still "once";
 *   - what Stripe has on a code, made here or in the creator's own dashboard
 *     (a minimum, a first order only, how long on a membership), is read back
 *     and said in plain words, without inventing any of it;
 *   - the studio's confirmation reader takes those fields only when they are
 *     well formed, and an answer without them still reads;
 *   - no product choice and no "first order" is offered for a code made here,
 *     and the editor says why in words;
 *   - the twenty codes and the pinned version are unchanged.
