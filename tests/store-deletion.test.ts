/**
 * Deleting one of an account's other stores, and what stops working with it
 * (lib/store.ts deleteStore; ClickFunnels audit F64, added 17 October 2026).
 *
 *   - only an extra store, with no products, no plan in good standing and no
 *     domain of its own, can be deleted; an account's first store never is;
 *   - once deleted, its address cannot be taken by anybody for its quarantine,
 *     so a link already shared leads nowhere rather than to a stranger;
 *   - its API keys open nothing, its team is not handed it, and it is no
 *     longer found by its id or address;
 *   - the defect found here: the route forgot a deleted store's email
 *     platform key, phones and notes, but kept its webhook endpoints — their
 *     addresses, often secret-bearing, and their signing secrets — and its
 *     API keys' records for good. Both are now forgotten with it
 *     (lib/webhooks.ts forgetStoreWebhooks, lib/api-keys.ts revokeAllKeys).
