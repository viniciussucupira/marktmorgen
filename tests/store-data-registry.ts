/**
 * What every key family a store can make in the database costs to keep, and
 * how it is bounded (added 18 October 2026, when the open item
 * database-storage of tests/plan-cost-registry.ts was closed).
 *
 * tests/store-data-registry.test.ts reads every key the code builds under
 * "nl:" (app/ and lib/), file by file, and fails when one is not here, or
 * when an entry here no longer matches anything. So a new key family cannot
 * be added without saying, here, how what it keeps is bounded:
 *
 *   - room: counted in the store's data room where it is written
 *     (lib/store-data.ts) and refused past it, or kept only while it fits;
 *     the files named must take and give it (takeData, needData, keepFor,
 *     noteData, giveData). Priced as the room: DATA_ROOM_BYTES of
 *     lib/store-data-rules.ts.
 *   - kept, item: written by an order and kept for as long as the store is,
 *     at most `kept` bytes an order and `item` bytes for each product it
 *     hands over: inside ORDER_DATA_BYTES and ITEM_DATA_BYTES, which every
 *     checkout holds before it opens (lib/order-admission.ts). Since 18
 *     October 2026 what each order really writes is charged to the room as
 *     it is written (lib/order-data.ts, orderWrite), so the file named must
 *     write through it; these ceilings bound only the hold.
 *   - per: written by one unit of a figure the store's window counts (an
 *     order, a public request, a studio request, an email...), at most
 *     `bytes` a unit, gone by itself within `days`. Parts of one `group` are
 *     never written by the same unit (each email is one kind of email), so a
 *     group costs its dearest part, not their sum.
 *   - capped: bounded by caps in the code, at most `capped(tier)` bytes per
 *     store, worked out from the constants named (checked to be there).
 *   - company: not a store's: an account, a person signing in, the company's
 *     own jobs, ledgers and indexes, which the fixed costs carry.
 *   - line: kept bytes already priced by another line of the cost registry.
 *
 * Bytes are review ceilings stated as such: a key's name, its value at the
 * largest the code writes, and what Redis keeps beside it (KEY for a small
 * key, ENTRY_BYTES for a field or member), rounded up.
 *
 * tests/plan-cost-registry.ts prices the room and these parts together at
 * Upstash's storage rate (line database-storage): the room full every day,
 * each part at what it keeps on average over a month (Upstash bills the
 * daily average, lib/spend-cost-table.ts), and once more what all of it can
 * keep at one time, for the closing days after a plan ends
 * (PER_PAYMENT_LINES).
