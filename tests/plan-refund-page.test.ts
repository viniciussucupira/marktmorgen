/**
 * The plan refund's review page (305 [SY1] unit 2b2, app/studio/refund),
 * rendered with the real reading, pass and words against the stand-in Stripe
 * of tests/plan-refund-stripe-world.ts; only the session and the studio's
 * header are stand-ins (tests/test-config.mjs). Nothing real is reached.
 *
 * What fails here: a confirm button for anyone but the owner, for a refusal,
 * or while an earlier refund is still being settled; an amount other than the
 * one the pass carries; a page that does not name the store; words saying the
 * creator's own Stripe account is untouched (closing stops its renewals).
