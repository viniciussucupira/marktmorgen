/**
 * Assignments on a lesson (lib/assignment.ts, added 11 October 2026). What
 * is checked:
 *
 *   - an assignment needs a prompt, and its three switches are read as given;
 *   - a student's file can only be one in their own folder for that lesson,
 *     of a kind that is taken;
 *   - handing in finishes the lesson at once when nobody reviews it, and
 *     waits for the creator when they do; approving finishes it, asking for
 *     another try does not, and work already answered is not answered twice;
 *   - an assignment that must be finished holds the lessons after it shut
 *     until it is;
 *   - a new file replaces the old one, which is handed back to be deleted;
 *   - what a store's students keep is held to its figure, and given back;
 *   - removing an assignment forgets the work and returns its files;
 *   - a file uploaded and never handed in is found a day later, and a door
 *     is used once;
 *   - the creator is emailed once an hour at most, the student in the
 *     store's language.
