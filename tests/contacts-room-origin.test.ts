/**
 * Where a contact's and a community member's room was taken is kept in the
 * record (Contact.r, Member.r), so deleting the person (lib/person-erasure.ts)
 * gives it back there, once: a contact from a sign-up to the contacts' slot,
 * one an order put on the list to the orders' part; a member's first write to
 * the orders' part and what it grew by to the members' slot. Records written
 * before the field existed are left counted, never given back by a guess.
 * A member's trace is given back by the deletion, and deleting a post or
 * comment of theirs afterward gives nothing back a second time.
