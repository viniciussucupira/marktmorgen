/**
 * The offers after paying, after a cart (556 [CT1], lib/cart-offers.ts;
 * added 1 November 2026). Against a stand-in for the creator's Stripe
 * account, checked:
 *
 *   - a cart with no product that has offers keeps no card and sets no key;
 *     one with such a product keeps the card exactly as one product does
 *     ("on_session", a customer made) and names whose offers follow;
 *   - whose: the first product in the cart's order with offers, never the
 *     next one's instead, and none when every offer is already in the cart;
 *   - passed over: what is in the cart, what the buyer bought here before,
 *     and what they turned down in this order; nothing left, nothing shown;
 *     what they own unreadable, nothing shown;
 *   - every protection of lib/upsell.ts holds after a cart: only the browser
 *     that paid, within the hour, a method one click cannot charge again
 *     meets no offer, each offer answered once, the bank's confirmation, and
 *     the offer's own price with the cart's deal not taken off again;
 *   - the checkout's named product is believed only when it is one of the
 *     cart's own lines;
 *   - the studio says it in one sentence, and an offer taken after a cart is
 *     the same "upsell" payment the numbers already count.
