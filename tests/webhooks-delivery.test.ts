/**
 * Webhooks delivered to a real HTTP endpoint (lib/webhooks.ts; ClickFunnels
 * audit F58, added 17 October 2026). Until this file no test had sent one:
 * the delivery here goes through lib/safe-fetch.ts to a local server, with
 * only the name lookup and the socket redirected (setSendHooksForTests), so
 * the address checks, the headers, the signature and the retries are the
 * production ones. Checked:
 *
 *   - an endpoint is https on a public host, five at most, each once, with at
 *     least one event; its secret is shown once;
 *   - a delivery is signed: HMAC-SHA256 of "<timestamp>.<body>" under the
 *     endpoint's secret, with the event id, type and delivery id in headers;
 *   - the same thing noticed twice is sent once; an endpoint hears only the
 *     events it chose;
 *   - an endpoint that fails is tried again on the published schedule with a
 *     fresh timestamp and signature and the same event id, so a receiver can
 *     refuse a stale replay and drop a repeat; after seven tries it is failed;
 *   - a redirect is not followed; a removed endpoint is not sent to;
 *   - one store can neither see, change, remove nor test another store's
 *     endpoints, and the same seed makes different event ids in two stores;
 *   - test messages are limited per minute;
 *   - since 18 October 2026 every try is one of the store's webhook
 *     deliveries for its month: past the figure nothing is sent, and the
 *     delivery is marked failed with the reason; a store with no plan sends
 *     none.
