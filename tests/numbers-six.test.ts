/**
 * The sixth part of the numbers, added on 11 October 2026: why members leave
 * and the next three months of memberships (lib/membership-numbers.ts), a
 * checkout Stripe would not open (lib/checkout-trouble.ts), the call on each
 * channel's ads and the day they paid back (lib/ad-spend-rules.ts), the
 * buyers' file for ad audiences (lib/ad-audience.ts), the month's goal
 * (lib/sales-goal-rules.ts), records (lib/records.ts), the monthly email
 * (lib/stats-report.ts) and the Slack or Discord summary
 * (lib/chat-summary.ts). What is checked:
 *
 *   - a member's own reason is read from Stripe and summed, a failed payment
 *     is not a choice, and a membership with a set end is not somebody leaving;
 *   - a forecast is only made from enough members, and says what it carries;
 *   - a refusal is counted and the creator told once a day, Stripe being down
 *     is counted and not emailed about;
 *   - the call speaks only above its floor, and payback counts renewals;
 *   - the audience file holds only buyers who agreed and are still on the list;
 *   - a goal, a record and a month are worked out from the days of money;
 *   - only a Slack or Discord address is ever kept, sealed, after it took a
 *     first message, and what is posted pings nobody.
