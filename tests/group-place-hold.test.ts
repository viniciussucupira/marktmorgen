 *
 * The same place link opened twice at once (a double click): run A holds the place and is handed the product; run B's
 * HSETNX really answers 0 but comes back in an unknown shape. B must never delete A's record of the place: the list
 * of who took a place is what a full refund walks (revokeRefundedGroups, HGETALL), so with A's record gone a refund
 * would leave A the product. Beside it, the healthy control and the cases where the hold is B's own (its HSETNX
 * landed, answered unknown; the places counter answered unknown), which are let go so the link works again.
