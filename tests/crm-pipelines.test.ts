/**
 * Several pipelines, and "a deal entered a stage" as a workflow trigger
 * (added 17 October 2026, HighLevel audit H02 and H18's stage trigger).
 * Checked against the in-memory Redis double, a stand-in email provider and
 * synthetic stores only:
 *
 *   - the rules: strict pipelines (no stage id in two, no name twice, every
 *     stage kept), the plan's number, the last pipeline kept, a stage with
 *     deals never removed without a chosen stage, honest totals;
 *   - the board a store had becomes the first pipeline with no write and no
 *     deal changed, and its old key keeps a copy of the first pipeline;
 *   - a deal moves between pipelines and keeps every other field; a stage
 *     or a pipeline removed moves its deals where the creator said, and a
 *     refusal writes nothing; a concurrent change is never overwritten;
 *   - the route enforces the plan's number of pipelines and the moves;
 *   - a deal made in or moved to a stage starts that stage's one workflow,
 *     once, only for somebody on the list, and the check takes one studio
 *     request; removal moves start nothing; one workflow a stage;
 *   - the check stays inside the studio request it takes.
