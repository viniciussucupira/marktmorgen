/**
 * A sales page drafted from the product's own PDF too (lib/ai.ts,
 * readPdfFacts; added 10 October 2026). The model is played by a stand-in
 * for `fetch`. What is checked: the first pages are cut from the file with
 * nothing past them; they go to the smaller model as a PDF, which is told to
 * list only what they show; what it lists is handed to the writer as the
 * product's contents; the reading takes its jobs from the month and gives
 * them back when nothing comes of it; a page can be drafted from the file
 * alone.
