/**
 * A certificate on LinkedIn (lib/certificate.ts, added 10 October 2026).
 * What is checked: the link to LinkedIn's "Add to Profile" form carries the
 * course as the certification, the creator as its issuer, the month it was
 * issued in, its ID and the page that proves it, all read from the record;
 * the link to a LinkedIn post carries the page; the words on both buttons
 * are in every store language; and the picture a shared link unfolds into
 * says only what the record says, and nothing for a certificate withdrawn.
