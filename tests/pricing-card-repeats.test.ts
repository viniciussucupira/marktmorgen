/**
 * 243 [CF6], the owner's complement of 31/10/2026 23h14: the pricing cards say
 * each figure once, the terms once under the three cards, and nothing on Store
 * is marked as included that only Studio and Scale have
 * (components/home-parts.tsx, app/pricing/page.tsx). The browser check of the
 * first screen at 1280 x 720 is in tests/e2e/pricing.mjs.
 *
 * What fails here:
 *   - a plan's figure (visits, orders, list emails, AI writing jobs, visitor
 *     answers, storage) said twice in what a card shows, outside its itemized
 *     list, which is closed until pressed;
 *   - a line with a check mark on Store for something only Studio and Scale have;
 *   - the terms, the "not open yet" line or the upload, storage and data-room
 *     paragraphs repeated in each card;
 *   - a figure no longer written anywhere on the card;
 *   - the plans no longer first on the page, before the tools and the comparison.
