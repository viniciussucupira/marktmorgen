/**
 * What a store may keep and play, by where it stands with its plan
 * (lib/plan-standing.ts).
 *
 * Opening a store costs nothing and asks for nothing but an email address.
 * Until this was written, such a store had the room of one that pays: two
 * hundred gigabytes kept, and four hundred hours of lesson video watched a
 * month. Nothing was set against either, so a free store address was a free
 * video host, for as long as anybody cared to use it as one.
 *
 * These hold the three things that close it: a store is read as paid, in
 * its trial, never started or ended from what its record says; each of
 * those has its own room; and the day a plan ends is written down once.
