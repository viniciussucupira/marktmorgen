/**
 * The page editor's right-hand column on a wide screen: the side menu of
 * blocks to add and the page as visitors see it share it, switched at its top
 * (lib/side-panel.ts, components/side-panel-switch.tsx,
 * components/page-editor.tsx; queue item 375 [TB1]).
 *
 * Seen in a browser at 1280 pixels: with the menu (15rem) and the page
 * (24.5rem) as two columns of their own, the blocks were edited in 182
 * pixels; "Add to column 1" cut "Smaller heading", a row's first field was
 * 31 pixels and the button opening a row had no width.
 *
 * What is checked, against the real code: one column beside the blocks,
 * the arithmetic that leaves the blocks at least 420 pixels at 1280, the
 * switch (two buttons saying which is on, as the editor's other switches),
 * the choice remembered in this browser only with the page as default, and
 * an "Add here" that shows the menu. Not checked here (needs a browser):
 * the widths drawn, and the focus landing in the search.
