/**
 * One-time and recurring on each step of a funnel (525 [FN1], unit 2,
 * complement of 30 October 2026; lib/funnel-results-rules.ts; added
 * 1 November 2026). Checked:
 *
 *   - each step has one-time orders and revenue, recurring orders (renewals
 *     of memberships that began on that step) and revenue, refunds apart, and
 *     a net that is one-time plus recurring less refunds;
 *   - the funnel's summary is made from the steps, so its totals are always
 *     the sum of the steps' parts;
 *   - an unknown part is unknown in the step and in every total that needs it,
 *     never 0;
 *   - a count is never written as money and money never as a count: each
 *     figure has its own label, in full words.
