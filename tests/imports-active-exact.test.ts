/**
 * Imports read Redis only in its exact shape (sweep A3 on lib/imports.ts, CX-123 rules 24 and 30), synthetic only:
 * the in-memory Redis double, with one command at a time answering in a shape Redis never gives.
 *
 *   - advanceImports (the five-minute job): a job whose GET answers in an unknown shape stays on the list of running
 *     imports and the pass throws UnknownReplyError; read again later, it advances and finishes. Only a job that
 *     is truly gone (GET answers nothing) leaves the list. Before, an unknown GET took it off the list for good while
 *     it kept the store's one-import slot for up to 14 days (tests/sweep-a3-import-active.proof.test.ts).
 *   - mailStep: an answer of unknown shape to the read of the queue (SRANDMEMBER) is not "nobody left to email",
 *     and one to the SREM that takes those addresses off puts them back; the import stays "mailing" with its
 *     addresses queued, and is marked done only once the queue is empty.
 *   - startImport: an unknown answer to the slot's SET NX is not "claimed"; nothing starts, so one store never runs
 *     two imports at once.
 *   - storeImports (the studio's list, rule 30): an unknown list, or an import on it answering in an unknown shape,
 *     throws rather than tell the creator no import is running and "None yet".
