/**
 * The EU withdrawal function, end to end (588 [KB9], unit 1b): the buyer's
 * list (lib/buyer-orders.ts reads the yes kept on each order), the statement's
 * page (app/[handle]/orders/withdraw/page.tsx), its route
 * (app/api/store/withdraw/route.ts) and lib/withdrawal.ts, against a stand-in
 * for the creator's Stripe account and the email service.
 *
 * Checked:
 *
 *   - an order still inside its period gets the function; one whose buyer
 *     gave the art. 16(m) yes for content already handed over does not;
 *   - the page fills in the link's address and asks for a name; "Confirm
 *     withdrawal" records the withdrawal once, emails the acknowledgement with
 *     its content and the date and time, and files the creator's notice;
 *   - a second statement for the same order sends nothing again, unless the
 *     acknowledgement never went: then it is sent again, with the first
 *     statement's time, at most WITHDRAWAL_ACK_SENDS times in all, and the
 *     creator is told only once;
 *   - a closed order, a name missing or an email that does not read records
 *     and sends nothing;
 *   - an order the link's address did not pay for is never withdrawn from;
 *   - nothing is ever written to the creator's Stripe account.
