/**
 * Renewals in the studio's numbers (lib/stats.ts, renewalsFrom and readSales,
 * added 11 October 2026). What is checked:
 *
 *   - a payment after the first is a paid invoice Stripe made because a
 *     period came round, on a subscription this store opened, in its
 *     currency: a first payment (a checkout, already a sale), an unpaid or
 *     free invoice, another store's or another currency's is not one;
 *   - the subscription's store is read where either of Stripe's API versions
 *     keeps it;
 *   - each is counted in the windows it falls in, and read beside the sales.
