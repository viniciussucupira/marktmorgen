/**
 * Earning and withdrawing a certificate of completion (lib/certificate.ts,
 * hasFinished, issueCertificate, withdrawCertificate; ClickFunnels audit F36,
 * added 17 October 2026). tests/certificate-pdf.test.ts and
 * tests/certificate-share.test.ts cover the file and the LinkedIn links;
 * this covers who gets one:
 *
 *   - finished means every lesson done and every quiz that must be passed
 *     passed; a course with no lessons is never finished;
 *   - the name is the one typed, cleaned of control and direction characters,
 *     two to eighty letters;
 *   - one standing certificate per student per course: asking again answers
 *     the same one, and two presses at the same moment make one — the defect
 *     found here: the slot was claimed before the record existed, so a second
 *     press in that moment read it as lost and issued a second certificate;
 *   - withdrawn, its page says so, it is no longer the student's, and the
 *     student may be issued a new one; a certificate of another course is
 *     not withdrawn through this one.
