/**
 * Where a usage pack's price comes from (18 October 2026): an ANALYSIS for
 * the owner, not a change. No price, limit, gate or tax assumption in code
 * changes with it, and nothing opens a sale.
 *
 * docs/pricing-usage-proposal-2026-10-18.md found that under the 60% rule a
 * unit of use has to sell at about twenty times what it costs (2,500 list
 * emails at $62, $24.80 a thousand, against HighLevel's $0.675). This file
 * takes that price apart, cent by cent, with the repository's own margin
 * code, and prices four structural options with the same code:
 *
 *   - every net, fee, reserve, tax and room is lib/receiving-costs.ts
 *     (unitUnder, receivingOf, costBudgetCents, the sizing reading);
 *   - every pack, its unit cost and its price is
 *     tests/pricing-usage-proposal-table.ts (PACKS, packPriceCents, atScale,
 *     linePriceCents), which reads the registry's unit costs;
 *   - the two supplier rates looked at again (Amazon SES for list email, R2
 *     for stored files) enter only as a pack's cost, through the same
 *     packPriceCents.
 *
 * Nothing here is margin arithmetic of its own: it only chooses what to take
 * apart, which sizes and credit amounts to look at, and the supplier rates
 * read on READ_ON, each with its page.
 *
 * `node scripts/pack-cost-decomposition.mjs` writes
 * docs/pack-cost-decomposition-2026-10-18.md from renderPackCostDecomposition();
 * tests/pack-cost-decomposition.test.ts fails when the file on disk is not
 * what this renders.
