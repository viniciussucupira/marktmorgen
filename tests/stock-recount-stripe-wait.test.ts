/**
 * One click waits on Stripe for at most one wave of checks (Claude 5's
 * review of #1732, 6 November 2026, LEVE in lib/stock.ts withCartStockHolds).
 *
 * A count refused only for holds that ran out has those holds settled once
 * the locks are let go (stockLeft asks Stripe about each, at most MAX_CHECKS,
 * each for at most CHECK_MS), and is counted again. When the write that
 * settles them is refused while reads still answer, the second count finds
 * the same holds: it must answer "busy" at once, not ask Stripe a second
 * time, so one click never waits longer than CART_STOCK_STRIPE_WAIT_MS.
 * Checked with Redis stubbed and Stripe mocked:
 *
 *   - the settling write refused: "busy", one wave of Stripe checks, nothing opened;
 *   - the settling write accepted: the first click opens (Claude 4's F2 on #1732);
 *   - a unit held by a checkout still open: "Sold out", Stripe not asked.
