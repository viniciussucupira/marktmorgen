/**
 * CX-123 rules 24 and 30, lists from Stripe, lot 3 (a) (money and access; C4-20261106-0450-C5-16): the refunds
 * that take a purchase for several back (lib/group-buy.ts, revokeRefundedGroups) are read in Stripe's exact list
 * shape (lib/stripe-list.ts, refundRowKnown in lib/refunds.ts) and to their end. Against a stand-in for Stripe:
 *
 *   - a page in another shape, or a row not readable, never moves the anchor, so those refunds are read again;
 *   - a refund on a later page is read and takes the purchase back, and the anchor moves only after the last page;
 *   - a refund on a readable row takes its purchase back even beside a row not readable (a "yes" stands), and the
 *     anchor stays;
 *   - more pages than one run reads leave the anchor where it was, and the next run goes on from where the last
 *     stopped, so a refund past them is reached (Codex G on #2781, M1);
 *   - a refund is marked handled only once its work was written: the group's close failing, or the reply that names
 *     its purchase lost, marks nothing, and a later run takes the purchase back (Codex G on #2781, M2);
 *   - a purchase already closed whose places were not all taken back (a run that stopped halfway) has them taken back
 *     now (Claude 4 on #2781, M3);
 *   - a refund whose purchase record does not read never holds back the refunds after it: it is kept on a short
 *     list tried first on every run, and let go only once handled (it never expires); with that list full, the pass
 *     stays on its page;
 *     an anchor in another shape starts no pass (Claude 4 on #2781, C4-20261106-0645-C5-25);
 *   - the places a purchase handed out are read exactly: a list of them in another shape (null, an odd length, a
 *     value not text) or one place that does not read is unknown, never "nobody": the refund is not marked, waits to
 *     be tried again, and a healthy run takes the place back (Codex G on #2781, proof 1e7a4920; C4-20261106-0710-C5-29);
 *   - every read is pinned to the lot's version.
