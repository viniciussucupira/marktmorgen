/**
 * The list's health as a table in the email studio (570 [DR1], unit 2;
 * components/list-health-table.tsx, lib/list-health-rules.ts; added 4
 * November 2026). Checked on the real component, rendered to markup:
 *
 *   - a caption, four column headers and two row headers, scoped;
 *   - each row's level said in words, from KB20's own healthLevels, never
 *     only by colour; the room from roomBeforePause; the shares from
 *     shareWords, rounded down as KB20 rounds them;
 *   - each row says the level that pauses, count and share both needed, so
 *     a high share beside a low level reads as it should;
 *   - at the level, both room cells say the next notice of either kind
 *     pauses (pauseIfOver runs after every one counted), and the distance
 *     sentence is not shown (KB20's advice already says so);
 *   - nothing sent: no table, one sentence;
 *   - no word that claims an outcome no sender can know, outside the one
 *     honest sentence that says so;
 *   - the words explained in place, and the markup bounded at any count;
 *   - the studio's email page shows it in the health section with the
 *     seven days it has already read: no new reading.
