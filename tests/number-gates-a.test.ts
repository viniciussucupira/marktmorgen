/**
 * Counters read in their exact shape before what they guard (audit SG2,
 * CX-123 rule 24; the margin rule's ceiling before every cost).
 *
 * Counters were read with Number(...): a reply that was missing, cut
 * short, of another shape or never came read as NaN (never past a ceiling)
 * or as 0/1 (always within it), so the call to Stripe, the email or the
 * write behind it went ahead on a count nobody had. Each is called here as
 * its route calls it, on the in-memory store, with only the counter's own
 * pipeline answered differently:
 *
 *   - lib/card-update.ts openCardUpdate: presses of the card link, before Stripe;
 *   - lib/group-buy.ts askPlace: places taken and links sent, before the email;
 *   - lib/group-buy.ts takePlace: the place being taken, before the product is given;
 *   - lib/free.ts requestCopy and spendClaim: requests an hour and uses of a link,
 *     before the email and before the file.
 *
 * An unknown reply is refused with the answer the code already gives when
 * something failed, and nothing behind the counter happens. A confirmed
 * count within the ceiling still goes through, and one past it is refused as
 * before.
