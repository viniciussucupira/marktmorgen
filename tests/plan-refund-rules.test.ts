/**
 * 232 [CA1] unit 6: what the plan's refund policy gives back is never more
 * than what was paid.
 *
 * app/refunds/page.tsx promises (sections 2, 3 and 5):
 *   - the first payment, refunded in full when asked within REFUND_DAYS;
 *   - a yearly payment, at any time, minus the months that have started at
 *     the plan's monthly price and minus Stripe's card fee on that payment;
 *   - nothing else (a monthly renewal, a switch charge, any later charge).
 *
 * The rule here is pure: it reads the charge as Stripe reports it (the amount
 * actually taken, so already net of coupons, discounts and customer balance;
 * what was already refunded; the dispute's status; the fee) and answers how
 * many cents a refund may be, or why there is none, or that it cannot tell
 * yet. Nothing here calls Stripe; 305 [SY1] builds the button on it.
