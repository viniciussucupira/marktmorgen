/**
 * A store's data room (lib/store-data.ts): what it keeps is taken before it
 * is written and refused past the room, what it deletes is given back, what
 * expires by itself comes off with its month, and an order is never refused
 * once paid, because its room was held when its checkout opened (what it
 * really writes is charged by lib/order-data.ts, tests/order-data.test.ts). Runs the
 * real code against the in-memory Redis (tests/redis-stub.ts);
 * scripts/test_store_data_redis.py runs the same script on a real Redis.
