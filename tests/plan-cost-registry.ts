/**
 * Every metered feature's per-store worst month, in one registry (added 17
 * October 2026). tests/plan-cost-model.ts sums COST_LINES into worstCost,
 * which tests/spend-floor.test.ts holds to the owner's 60% after the 27.5%
 * stress tax, and tests/plan-cost-registry.test.ts fails when:
 *
 *   - a line's sources do not hold the constants it names (moved or renamed);
 *   - a counter in the code (withinLimit, withinMonth, withinStore,
 *     withinService, countUse) has a scope that no entry of SCOPES classifies,
 *     a store figure (takeAllowance) has a kind no line prices, or a file
 *     sends email with a meter EMAIL_SITES does not allow it;
 *   - an exported limit or cost constant in lib/ (a name with _PER_DAY,
 *     _MONTHLY, _INCLUDED, WORST_, _LIMITS, _BY_TIER, ALLOWANCE...) is cited by
 *     no line, no open item and no entry of NOT_A_COST.
 *
 * So a feature cannot add a per-use cost without saying where it is counted.
 *
 * Each line is the most one store on a plan can cost in one window at every
 * enforced cap at once, in dollars, from the rates in
 * lib/spend-cost-table.ts and tests/traffic-cost.ts. A request is costed by
 * the call, its CPU, 2 GB of memory for its wall time, its database commands
 * and the bytes it moves through the database; the shapes below are review
 * ceilings stated as such, like the visit's own (tests/traffic-cost.ts).
 * Daily windows that start with their first use can touch 32 windows of a
 * 31-day month; UTC-day and calendar-month counters touch 31 and 1.
 *
 * The window (since 17 October 2026, lib/allowance-window.ts) is the store's
 * billing month: one payment, one window, a monthly plan's period or a yearly
 * plan's month on the day it began, at most 31 days. So each allowance is
 * counted once per payment, as the floor test prices it. A billing month
 * touches 32 UTC days (part of its first and last), so a counter by the UTC
 * day is priced at DAY_WINDOWS, and one by the calendar month at two.
 *
 * OPEN lists the per-use costs that no monthly figure bounds yet. They are
 * not in worstCost, so the floor test does not certify them: the owner's rule
 * counts them as failing until each has a figure here.
 *
 * PER_PAYMENT_LINES (since 18 October 2026) are what one payment can leave
 * behind after its plan ends: what the store keeps until its closing day
 * (lib/plan-closing.ts), and its closing itself (closure). They happen once
 * a payment at the most, not once a window, and tests/spend-floor.test.ts
 * adds them once to each payment's worst case: so a store that paid once, a
 * single month, and closed carries all of it in that payment's own margin.
