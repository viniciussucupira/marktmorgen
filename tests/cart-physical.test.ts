/**
 * Physical products in the cart (513 [PF1], unit 2b; lib/cart-rules.ts,
 * lib/cart-checkout.ts, lib/cart-shipping.ts, app/api/store/cart; added 2
 * November 2026). Checked, with Stripe mocked:
 *
 *   - a product the creator ships goes in a cart, at one price, limited or
 *     not; one with sizes does not, yet;
 *   - the checkout asks Stripe for an address only in the countries they
 *     all ship to, adds each one's shipping on one line, says when it ships
 *     only when that is one line, marks the order as shipped, and with
 *     Stripe Tax on (added or included) taxes the shipping as shipping and
 *     each shipped line as goods; the deal for buying more never touches
 *     the shipping;
 *   - a cart whose products share no country, or that mixes shipped
 *     products with ones handed over online, opens nothing, and the route
 *     sends the buyer back to the cart;
 *   - a cart of shipped products only needs no box to start at once;
 *   - the open cart says, before paying, what each product's shipping is,
 *     what shipping comes to and where it can go, the visitor's country when
 *     it is not one of them, and which products to take out, with the total
 *     what Stripe will charge before tax and the deal's saving without the
 *     shipping;
 *   - the thanks page says a second shipped product goes to the same address.
