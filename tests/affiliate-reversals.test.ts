/**
 * What an affiliate earns once the money has moved again (lib/affiliates.ts,
 * readBook, noteSession; ClickFunnels audit F44–F50, added 17 October 2026).
 *
 * The defect this file was written around: commission was settled against
 * the refunds on the creator's Stripe account and nothing else. A chargeback
 * is not a refund — Stripe takes the money back through a dispute and no
 * refund is ever made — so a sale charged back still earned its affiliate the
 * full share, and the payout batch was built on it. The book now reads the
 * disputes beside the refunds (disputesSince). Checked:
 *
 *   - a refund in full takes the commission, a partial one leaves it on what
 *     was kept;
 *   - a dispute the bank is holding, or the buyer won, takes it too; an
 *     inquiry takes nothing, and a dispute the creator won earns again;
 *   - disputes that could not be read leave the book "not checked", and a
 *     payout batch is refused on such a book;
 *   - nobody earns on their own purchase, including from their inbox written
 *     another way; the creator cannot apply to their own programme;
 *   - a code typed at checkout credits the affiliate it was given to when no
 *     link was followed, never over a link, and never somebody removed.
