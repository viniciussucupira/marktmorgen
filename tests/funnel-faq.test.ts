/**
 * Questions from someone starting out, on the funnels page (534 [FQ1], unit
 * 1, lib/funnel-faq.ts; added 1 November 2026). Checked, as the item asks:
 *
 *   - the six questions are in the page's existing "Questions" block, and its
 *     FAQPage data is built from the same items (components/topic-page.tsx);
 *   - every kind of funnel is named with its own hint, from the code;
 *   - the steps are the studio's own buttons, and no time is promised;
 *   - "Can I try it": while plans are not on sale it says so and points to
 *     the demo, marked as one; once on sale the trial's days come from the
 *     code; it never starts with "free";
 *   - opens: none counted, said in the words the email page already uses;
 *   - "Do funnels work?": no number of customers or sales; the example line
 *     is the studio's own, from lib/funnel-metrics.ts;
 *   - no forbidden word, no http:// link, no other number but the code's.
