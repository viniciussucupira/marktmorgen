/**
 * CX-123 rule 24, lot L10b: the replies Upstash could give a SET NX, or the GET that reads it back, and the stand-in
 * never does, injected for one command at a time. A rule matches a pipeline by its first command; the command may run
 * first (the write landed and the reply was lost) or not at all (the write did not land), and something may be written
 * just before it (another request taking the key a moment earlier). Every command sent is recorded, so a test can see
 * whether the guarded action ran. Rules apply in the order given, so a read-back's rule never answers an earlier read.
