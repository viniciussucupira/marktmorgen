/**
 * The buyer help (lib/buyer-help.ts) promises only what the code does
 * (Codex L on #1898, C3-132), against the in-memory Redis double and
 * synthetic HTTP only:
 *
 *   - the library lists the stores bought from up to MAX_LIBRARY_STORES, so
 *     the help never says "every store" and says the real reach;
 *   - an email that reaches the store when replied to is only the order
 *     confirmation (its replyTo is the store's address); a sign-in link for
 *     the orders or a membership comes from the site with no replyTo, so the
 *     help never says a reply to "any email" reaches the creator.
