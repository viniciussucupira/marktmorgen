/**
 * An email's body and the designer that writes it (lib/mail-body.ts, added
 * 13 October 2026). What is checked:
 *
 *   - blocks and text go back and forth without losing anything;
 *   - a heading, a button, a line across are drawn as such, everything
 *     escaped, a button only to an https address, carrying the email's tag;
 *   - the plain-text version says each in words;
 *   - a template's parts left to write stop an email from going out.
