/**
 * Copying a whole store into another store of the same account
 * (app/api/store/store-copy, lib/store-copy.ts, lib/store-copy-rules.ts;
 * added 18 October 2026), end to end through the route against the
 * in-memory Redis:
 *
 *   - only the account's owner, only between its own stores;
 *   - the preview writes nothing and says what is made, what is left out
 *     and what does not fit; a copy that does not fit as a whole (another
 *     currency, a data room too full, the month's studio requests) is
 *     refused before anything is written;
 *   - the copy makes drafts of the products (words, prices, checkout boxes
 *     mapped, long descriptions, pages of blocks without pictures), the
 *     forms without an answer, the pages kept back, the funnels off, and the
 *     setup when asked, with every product they name mapped to its copy;
 *   - nothing personal and nothing of the first store's comes across: no
 *     customer, contact, answer, review, order, file, picture, Stripe
 *     account or store id;
 *   - done twice, or after its progress is lost, it makes nothing twice;
 *   - each step is charged to the other store's studio requests before it
 *     writes, and its store commands, measured, stay inside what it is
 *     charged for.
