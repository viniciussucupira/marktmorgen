/**
 * The count before sending (460 [EL4], unit 1, lib/send-count.ts; added
 * 1 November 2026). Checked:
 *
 *   - what one email to the list is of this month's emails, and how many
 *     times the month still lets the creator write to the same people;
 *   - past what is left, it says so and offers only what exists today (a
 *     smaller group, or next month), never a way to send more;
 *   - nobody to send to, or numbers that are not counts: nothing is said;
 *   - the composer shows it next to the recipient count, from the numbers
 *     the page already has, and still sends nothing by itself.
