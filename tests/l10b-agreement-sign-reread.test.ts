/**
 * Revisor 1's LEVE on #2723: signAgreement saved the signature and the reply was lost, so the signer saw "error",
 * no copies went out, and the next try said "changed". Now the record is read back exactly after a save that did
 * not answer OK: only this very signature on this version counts as signed; a save that did not land, or a
 * read-back that does not read, stays "error".
