/**
 * The twelve cron jobs' one-run-at-a-time locks read exactly (CX-123 rules 24 and 30; sweep APP4 findings 1 and 3).
 *
 * plans, closing, affiliates, imports, closed-data, recount, monthly, weekly, stripe-check, shares, stream and
 * mail-check took their lock with SET NX, read only nil as "another run holds it" and anything else (no reply, a
 * reply in another shape) as theirs, and let go with a plain DEL whoever held it. So a lost answer let a job run
 * beside another run of itself (payment-plan charges, affiliate payouts, plan refunds, closed-store erasure) and
 * delete that run's lock. They now read the lock as lot L10a's jobs do (lib/claim-mark.ts) and as Claude 4's fix of
 * cron/mail does: "OK", or this run's own value read back, is ours; nil, or another value read back, is busy; any
 * other answer is unknown, answered 503 `lock_unknown`, nothing run and nothing let go. At the end a run lets go of
 * its lock only while it still holds its own value (releaseMark, one compare-and-delete script).
 *
 * Also the weekly job (finding 3): when a store's numbers cannot be read, the week's claim is let go and the store
 * is counted "failed", as the monthly job does, so a later run that week sends the email.
 *
 * Synthetic only: Redis is the in-memory double, Stripe, Bunny and the email provider are stand-ins.
