/**
 * The studio's view of each product's pre-orders and a person's pre-orders in the copy of their data, read only in
 * their exact shape (CX-123 rule 24; rule-30 siblings of waitingCount, tests/preorders-waiting-unknown.test.ts).
 * Synthetic only: the in-memory Redis double, every fetch answers 404.
 *
 * Before: lib/preorders.ts read an HVALS or HGETALL that answered no reply, a number or text as "no pre-orders":
 *   1. preorderViews: the studio said a product had no pre-orders (and offered "Take pre-orders" as if none were
 *      ever taken) while buyers who paid waited; the pre-order switch answered ok with 0 waiting;
 *   2. preordersOf: the copy of a person's data was handed over without their paid pre-orders in it.
 * Now: an unknown read throws UnknownReplyError; the switch answers 503 "preorders_unread" (its day is saved, the
 * counts are not invented); the studio says the pre-orders could not be read; the copy is not made.
 * And the day's own HSET/HDEL answered in another shape throws PreorderDayUnconfirmed: the switch answers 502
 * "day_unconfirmed", never ok and never "Saved." (independent review of #3005, LEVE).
