/**
 * Emails published on the store (lib/letter-rules.ts, lib/letters.ts, the
 * route; docs/zero-cost-value-2026-10-18.md item 1; added 18 October 2026).
 *
 * Checked, in the in-memory Redis:
 *
 *   - only an email this store sent is published, never one scheduled,
 *     cancelled or another store's, and only by a role that may send;
 *   - what is published is the subject and words as sent, the links as typed,
 *     and nothing about who received it; its id is not the email's own;
 *   - the copy and its entry take their room in the data room first, and a
 *     store keeps at most MAX_PUBLISHED_LETTERS;
 *   - taking it off deletes the copy; a closing store's copies are found;
 *   - the store commands each action sends, measured.
