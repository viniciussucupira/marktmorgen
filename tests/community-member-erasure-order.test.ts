/**
 * A community member's own record is read first and taken last (Claude 5's second review of #2576, items 2 and 3):
 * what it names elsewhere (their handle, their unsubscribe token, whose record holds their address) goes while the
 * record can still be found, so one failed step leaves everything for the next try; and a reply that is not exact is
 * unknown, never "no member". Synthetic records (MemoryRedis); no outside request.
