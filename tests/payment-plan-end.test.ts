/**
 * A payment plan stops by itself after its last payment (lib/plans.ts,
 * finishPlan and settlePlans; ClickFunnels audit F14, added 17 October 2026).
 *
 * A plan is a subscription on the creator's own Stripe account that must
 * never charge one payment too many. Checked against a stand-in for Stripe:
 *
 *   - three monthly payments end at the close of the third period, from the
 *     cycle's anchor, with no proration;
 *   - a membership set to end after twelve payments counts from the end of
 *     its free trial, where its first payment is taken;
 *   - a plan already given its end, or already canceled, is not touched again;
 *   - a checkout still open waits; one never paid, or that is neither a plan
 *     nor a membership with an end, is let go without any change;
 *   - the job settles each pending plan once and keeps an open one for two days.
