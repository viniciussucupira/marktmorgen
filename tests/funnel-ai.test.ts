/**
 * A whole funnel drafted with AI (lib/funnel-ai.ts, lib/funnel-ai-rules.ts),
 * through the studio's own routes. The model is played by a stand-in for
 * `fetch`; the AI spending policy is the approving test double every writing
 * test uses (tests/ai-spend-regression-stub.ts), so this checks what the
 * feature does with admission, not the ledger itself. What is checked:
 *
 *   - its weight is the requests' bounds, said before it runs, and taken
 *     from the month's jobs before any request: refused without enough
 *     left, kept when an attempt fails, never charged for a refusal;
 *   - it drafts from the store's own records, into the guided setup's own
 *     structures: invented numbers removed, offers only from the store's
 *     products, links only the store's, subscription left to the visitor;
 *   - the research cites only the store's dated records and drops what they
 *     do not hold, and says it searched nothing on the web;
 *   - the setup saves the drafted blocks into hidden pages, and a page still
 *     holding a part ⟦like this⟧ cannot be shown to visitors.
