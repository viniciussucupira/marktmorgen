/**
 * What one opening of a buyer's orders page may ask of the creator's Stripe
 * account and send to the browser, at the most (C3-80, 4 November 2026; the
 * reviewers' findings on #2060, measured with Codex's cost baseline,
 * codex/buyer-orders-cost-baseline 051129f, whose scenario is reused here):
 *
 *   - a hundred purchases paid in installments made 1,216 calls to Stripe in
 *     one opening; now at most ORDERS_STRIPE_CALLS, the refund checks spent
 *     on the newest, and the page says some purchases could not be checked,
 *     never that they were not bought;
 *   - forty purchases of four twenty-product bundles with links of 2,000
 *     characters drew 14.19 MB of HTML; a bundle's products are now behind a
 *     button that reads them when asked (app/api/store/orders/bundle), and a
 *     page drawn at every limit the store has stays under ORDERS_PAGE_BYTES,
 *     the bytes ORDERS_OPEN_READ pays for (tests/plan-cost-registry.ts);
 *   - that button's answer stays under ORDERS_BUNDLE_BYTES, takes
 *     ORDERS_BUNDLE_UNITS before anything is read, and refuses without reading.
 *
 * What a page sends is measured as the App Router sends it (tests/page-response.ts):
 * its HTML, its RSC payload drawn by React's own Flight server and embedded as
 * Next embeds it, and the shell measured on a local production build. Measured with the HTML alone,
 * the page at every limit was 2.51 MB under 2.65 MB; as sent, with every text
 * made of the character that costs the most in both (&: five bytes in the
 * HTML, six in the payload's script), it was 5.08 MB (review of
 * claude3/orders-page-bounds, 4 November 2026).
 *
 * Without JavaScript, the same buttons send forms the page answers itself,
 * read and paid for exactly as the buttons' requests are (lib/purchase-cards.ts,
 * askBundle and askOlder).
 *
 * Synthetic records and a stand-in Stripe only: nothing real is charged, sent or read.
