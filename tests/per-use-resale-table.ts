/**
 * Whether to resell per-use services at a profit (18 October 2026): an
 * ANALYSIS for the owner, not a change. No price, limit or gate in code
 * changes, and sales stay closed.
 *
 * For each candidate (SMS, WhatsApp, phone numbers and calls, AI voice,
 * extra list emails, video hours, captions, AI): the supplier's published
 * unit price at its dearest (docs/per-use-resale-data-2026-10-18.json, each
 * with its page and day), what competitors charge, and the price per unit
 * that keeps 60% per customer at full use, sold from prepaid credits (the
 * owner's rule: the customer pays first, use stops at zero; the structure of
 * docs/pack-cost-decomposition-2026-10-18.md, option 3). Every rate is
 * checked with lib/receiving-costs.ts `unitUnder`: the whole credit spent on
 * that one service, its fixed monthly costs included, keeps 60% with the
 * add-on's 25¢ of room.
 *
 * `node scripts/per-use-resale.mjs` writes docs/per-use-resale-2026-10-18.md;
