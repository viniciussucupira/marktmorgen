/**
 * MM-SA-03: a signature, or a new version, could be erased by an email
 * about the same agreement.
 *
 * A signature and a new version are written under the agreement's lock
 * (lib/agreement-store.ts). The emails about it were not: sending the link
 * again (sendAgain, sendAgreementEmail) and sending the signed copy again
 * (resendSignedCopy) read the record, waited for the email to go, and wrote
 * back the whole record they had read. A person who signed while the creator
 * pressed "send again" had their signature taken off the record, which then
 * read as waiting for one; a version written while a signed copy was being
 * sent again was lost from the record.
 *
 * Proved against a real Redis, with the email sender held at its slow step:
 * every signature and every version written meanwhile must still be on the
 * record afterward.
