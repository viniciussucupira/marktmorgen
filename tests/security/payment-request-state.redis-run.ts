/**
 * MM-SA-02: a paid payment request could be written back as open.
 *
 * A request's record is read, changed and written back by several hands: the
 * reminder that emails it (lib/payment-requests.ts, sendRequestEmail), the
 * press that opens its checkout (openRequestCheckout), the creator's cancel,
 * and the buyer coming back from paying (markPaid). Each wrote the whole
 * record it had read, so one that had read it before the payment and wrote
 * after it — a reminder still sending its email, a checkout still being
 * opened at Stripe — put the request back to open. Open again, it emailed
 * the person who had paid more reminders and opened a second checkout for a
 * second payment.
 *
 * Proved against a real Redis: each of those writers is held at its slow
 * step (the email, Stripe's answer) while the buyer's payment is written,
 * and the request must stay paid, its reminders stopped, and no second
 * checkout opened for it.
