/**
 * The fourth part of the numbers, added on 11 October 2026: how a page is
 * read (lib/page-read.ts), each figure beside the stretch before it, the AI
 * assistants as channels, notes on the chart (lib/stats-notes.ts), what was
 * spent on ads (lib/ad-spend-rules.ts), "where did you hear about us?"
 * (lib/heard.ts), the email when sales stop (lib/quiet-sales.ts), and who
 * stays (lib/membership-numbers.ts). What is checked:
 *
 *   - a page's token opens its own store's numbers for its own page and no
 *     other, and the store page's items are read back in order, each with how
 *     many reached it and clicked it;
 *   - all-time views are the sum of all-time sources, a record from before
 *     keeps what it counted, and a view writes no all-time "v";
 *   - each window is set beside the same stretch before it, for visits and
 *     for money, and money read in part is said to be unknown, not zero;
 *   - ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini and Gmail are named for what they are, and
 *     ChatGPT's own tag is the same channel as a visit it sent;
 *   - a note and a line of ad spend take only what they should, and spend is
 *     spread over the days it ran;
 *   - an answer is counted once, for a paid order of this store, and only
 *     while the creator asks;
 *   - a quiet stretch is quiet against the store's own pace, and the email
 *     goes once, only where it may;
 *   - a cohort is read only at ages all its members have reached.
