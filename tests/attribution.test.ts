/**
 * Where the money came from, three ways side by side, and how long after a
 * visit a sale is credited to it (lib/attribution-rules.ts,
 * lib/visit-channel.ts; added 12 October 2026). Checked:
 *
 *   - the window a creator chooses, and only the four it can be;
 *   - the channel cookie kept 90 days and read with the store's window;
 *   - each channel's money by the last visit, the first and what buyers said,
 *     on one row, answers that name several channels beside them;
 *   - the sales with no channel, split by what their buyers said, counted
 *     when the answer is given;
 *   - the studio's numbers carry it for each window, with the store's window.
