/**
 * 618 [SZ2] unit 3: the legal information fields of a physical product reach
 * the buyer, and the EU/EEA countries stay off its checkout while they are
 * not filled (docs/sz2-physical-legal-fields.md, "Next units", 2).
 *
 *   - the product page shows, before the buy button, the fields the creator
 *     filled (manufacturer, the EU responsible person when the manufacturer is
 *     outside the EU/EEA, type or model, warnings or the "no warnings"
 *     statement), the creator's Proposition 65 text and the unit price, under
 *     a heading, in a definition list, as text (AX274 2.4.10, 1.4.9, 3.1.4);
 *   - the checkout of one product and of a cart leaves out the EU/EEA
 *     countries while gpsrClosedCountries says so; a product that ships
 *     nowhere else is not sold; unknown (an unreadable record, a forged mark)
 *     is closed, never open;
 *   - the listing carries only a computed mark, so the store page and the
 *     cart know without reading the legal record; the product page reads it
 *     from the product's own record, in parallel, and nothing else;
 *   - the buyer's words in the seven store languages.
