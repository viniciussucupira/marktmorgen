/**
 * A certificate of completion as a PDF file (lib/certificate-pdf.ts, added
 * 11 October 2026). What is checked:
 *
 *   - one landscape US Letter page, with the store as its author;
 *   - the letters cover the names a store in Europe or the Americas meets,
 *     Polish, Czech, Turkish, Greek and Russian included, and say no to a
 *     script they do not cover rather than drawing empty boxes;
 *   - a very long name or title still fits the sheet.
