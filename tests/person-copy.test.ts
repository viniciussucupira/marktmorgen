/**
 * 619 [SZ3] unit 1: the copy of what one store keeps about one person. Every
 * module the erasure reaches is said in COPY_PLAN, and every one marked
 * copied has a reader; while any is pending the copy is not complete and no
 * door gives it out. Made from a store with a contact, the team's note, a
 * deal, a task the team wrote about them (given to a teammate), an inbox
 * conversation with a reply: the person's data is in it, a teammate's
 * address is not, and nothing in the database changed.
