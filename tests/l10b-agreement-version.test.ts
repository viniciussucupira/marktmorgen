/**
 * CX-123 rule 24, lot L10b: a new version of an agreement (lib/agreement-store.ts reviseAgreement) writes its exact text
 * once, with SET NX, before the record names it. A reply to that SET in any shape but "OK" or nil is read back: the key
 * holding this version's own text is ours and the record names it; another text is never named by the record (its
 * fingerprint would not be the text kept); nothing readable is "unavailable", and a text this run may have written is
 * let go only while it is still this run's own, so the creator's next try can write that version.
