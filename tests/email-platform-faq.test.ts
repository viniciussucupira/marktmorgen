/**
 * The questions someone starting out asks about connecting an email platform
 * (534 [FQ1], unit 26, lib/email-platform-faq.ts; added 2 November 2026).
 * Checked: the studio's own words, read from its files, in the order the
 * answer gives them; the page for whoever may change settings, with no plan
 * read by its route; the warning where keys cannot be kept; each platform's
 * key told where to find; nobody sent before a sign-up or a sale, both
 * needing the plan or its trial; the shared trial answer in both states; no
 * sentence said twice on the page; no figure; first in the page's own
 * Questions block.
