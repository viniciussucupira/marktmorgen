/**
 * Deleting a person, end to end (added 17 October 2026), against whichever
 * Redis "@/lib/redis" is built with: the in-memory one in
 * tests/person-erasure.test.ts, a real one in
 * scripts/test_contact_erasure_redis.py.
 *
 * A store is made and somebody else put in every part of it; everything
 * Redis holds is read. Then the person is put in every part of it too
 * (tests/erasure-world.ts) and deleted, by their own emailed link, and
 * everything is read again: what was there before them must be there as it
 * was, and nothing of theirs may be left but the store's fingerprint of
 * their address, the activity log's line, the counts that pay for it, and
 * the records the registry says are kept (lib/person-data.ts). Then the
 * same through the studio's door, where their reviews and what an import
 * gave them stay, as that door promises.
