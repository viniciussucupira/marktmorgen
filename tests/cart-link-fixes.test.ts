/**
 * 624 [SZ8](23), the three MEDIUMs of Codex G2 on #1928, checked on the code:
 *
 *   1. the builder shows a short link only on an answer that confirms the
 *      very link asked for (2xx, ok exactly true, one link with this name, a
 *      code of the right shape and this cart: these products in this order
 *      and this code); a refusal is believed only when it says so in full,
 *      and anything else says it is not known, never "made";
 *   2. an answer is read against what was asked when it was sent (the screen
 *      keeps the short link with what it was made for and shows it only
 *      while it still asks for the same);
 *   3. the builder's products are chosen from the index without a read, at
 *      most CART_LINK_CHOICES, and the listings not already in the store
 *      record are weighed and paid for in studio requests before any is
 *      read; refused, nothing is read and nothing is offered.
