/**
 * A buyer's page in the studio (lib/buyer-profile.ts, added 11 October
 * 2026). Checked:
 *
 *   - only this store's sales are on it, each payment counted once: a
 *     checkout, a one-click extra after it, a membership's first invoice
 *     folded into its sale and a later one shown as a payment of its own;
 *   - what was given back is taken off, whole or in part, and money in
 *     another currency is kept apart;
 *   - where they first found the store, and where the latest sale came from;
 *   - the membership's state, the course's progress, the list's record;
 *   - notes are kept under a key that is not the address, one field each,
 *     at most MAX_PERSON_NOTES, and all of a store's go when it is deleted;
 *   - a search's token opens the page on the store it was made on only, and
 *     a sale opens its buyer only when it is this store's.
