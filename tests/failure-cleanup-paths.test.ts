/**
 * A request that fails never deletes a file the browser named unless that request took it as a fresh upload
 * (4 November 2026, after a review proved a member with only "page" deleting a product's picture).
 *
 * A store's pictures share one folder, and a product's files and its episodes share the product's folder; the
 * routes only check the folder. So a path the browser sends on a failed request may be another record's file.
 * Each check sends the real route a real request from the creator's own session, with synthetic files in a file
 * store held in memory (tests/failure-cleanup-world.ts), and reads what is left:
 *
 *   - a link's picture refused (no size, or no such link) with a product's picture named: the picture stays;
 *   - a product's picture refused (no such product) with another product's picture named: it stays;
 *   - a smaller copy refused (as wide as the picture) that is another product's smaller copy: it stays;
 *   - an episode refused (no title) naming another episode's audio: the audio stays;
 *   - and what is still cleaned: a picture let in through the door for this request, then refused, is deleted;
 *     once put on something it is never taken as fresh again, and a door asked for a picture already stored is
 *     refused, even in the same second the picture was stored;
 *   - each store's list: a stale note is never taken, one store's doors never push out another's, and the list
 *     expires a window after its last note.
 *
 * The inventory at the end reads every deletion in app/api/store, and in the lib files those routes delete through,
 * and holds each to a reason it cannot reach a file the browser named that belongs to another record, so a new
 * one fails here until somebody says which; and each route taking from the door takes before it deletes.
