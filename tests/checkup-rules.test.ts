/**
 * "Something's not working" (491 [PP2], unit 1, lib/checkup-rules.ts; added
 * 1 November 2026). Checked:
 *
 *   - every check says "not checked" when its reader could not answer, and
 *     never "ok" then;
 *   - a problem always has what was found, what happens if it is left, and a
 *     fix: a studio page, or the exact place outside it;
 *   - a part the store does not use is left out, not called fine;
 *   - the parts with no reader yet are always "not checked";
 *   - problems come first, then what was not checked, then what is fine;
 *   - the line at the top never says all is well while anything was not
 *     checked;
 *   - no model is asked and nothing is fetched.
