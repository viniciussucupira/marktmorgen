/**
 * The 90% cap on what one sale may promise (partners plus the affiliate commission, lib/partner-share.ts) is checked
 * again when a partner ACCEPTS, not only when the creator invites (#2995 review, MÉDIO, money). Synthetic only: the
 * in-memory Redis double, through the real route app/api/store/affiliates/route.ts and openAffiliateLink.
 *
 * Before: the invitation was checked against the partners approved at that moment, and accepting it wrote the share
 * as it was. Two 80% invitations on one product were each inside the cap alone; both accepted, the product promised
 * partners 160% of each sale, on top of the 5% commission.
 *
 * Now: accepting re-reads the program's people exactly (listAffiliates) and re-checks the cap under the program's
 * partner lock, the same lock a share set from the studio takes, so two acceptances at once cannot both pass.
 * Over the cap: refused, the offer (or the emailed link) kept. Unknown reply, or the lock not taken: refused as
 * unavailable (503), the offer kept, nothing written.
