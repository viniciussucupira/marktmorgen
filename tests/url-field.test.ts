/**
 * A web address checked when the person leaves the field (487 [IT4],
 * pattern 1; added 1 November 2026; lib/url-check.ts,
 * components/url-field.tsx). Checked:
 *
 *   - the check is the server's own reading (readLink in lib/product-link.ts),
 *     so the field never passes what the save refuses, or refuses what it keeps;
 *   - an empty optional field is fine;
 *   - an address missing https:// is offered back with it, in one press,
 *     only when that makes it one the server keeps; an http:// one too;
 *   - nothing is said while the person is still typing: only after they
 *     leave the field, and the message goes as soon as the address is right;
 *   - the message is tied to the field (aria-describedby, aria-invalid) and
 *     the fix is a real button at least 44 px tall;
 *   - the lesson link in the course editor uses it, with a visible label.
