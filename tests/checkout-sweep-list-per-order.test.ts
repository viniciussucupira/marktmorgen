/**
 * The buyer-list loop of the checkout sweep (lib/checkout-sweep.ts): one order whose products cannot be read never
 * holds back the orders behind it (Claude 4, C4-2990). Order A, already confirmed on its thanks page, bought a hidden
 * product, whose record is read from Redis; that read throws while it lasts. B, the older order, bought a visible
 * one. Before the per-order catch, A's throw ended the store's pass: B was never put on the list, and the run said
 * nothing had failed. Real sweep on the in-memory Redis; Stripe's list stubbed.
