/**
 * A lesson's quiz drafted with AI (lib/quiz-draft.ts and lib/ai.ts,
 * writeQuiz, added 10 October 2026). What is checked:
 *
 *   - what the model sends is read safely: a question with no text, repeated
 *     answers, too few answers, or no right answer among them is left out,
 *     never repaired by guess; several right answers make it a question with
 *     several; never more than asked for;
 *   - the answers are shuffled so the right one is never in the same place
 *     two questions in a row, and the right answers stay right;
 *   - the writer is handed the lesson's text and the creator's words, asked
 *     for that many questions in the store's language, and counted as one job;
 *     with neither text nor words it is not asked at all.
