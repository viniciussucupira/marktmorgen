/**
 * Rule 24 where money and other people's systems hang on a read (lib/upsell.ts,
 * lib/webhooks.ts): a reply in an unknown shape is never "no affiliate", never
 * "no such offer", never "this click may charge" and never "no webhook settings".
 *
 *   - a one-click offer whose affiliate cannot be read is not charged at all,
 *     rather than charged without the affiliate's share on it;
 *   - an offer's once-only claim (SET NX) is ours on "OK", or read back holding
 *     its own value; another press's on null; a claim that landed is never stuck;
 *   - the five-minute job keeps an offer waiting on Stripe on its list while
 *     its record cannot be read; a record that is gone still lets it go;
 *   - the Stripe watch keeps a store whose webhook settings cannot be read; a
 *     store with none is still let go;
 *   - a queued delivery whose record cannot be read stays queued; one that is
 *     gone is still taken off;
 *   - an event is never said to have no listeners when the settings cannot be read.
 *
 * Synthetic store, checkout and Stripe answers; nothing leaves this machine.
