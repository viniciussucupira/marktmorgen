/**
 * The warnings on a creator's own terms, refund policy and description
 * (493 [DE2] unit 1, lib/terms-check-rules.ts). Pure: nothing is reached.
 *
 * What fails here: a warning missing for another company's name or site, a
 * price that differs from the checkout's, "no refunds" where the immediate-
 * access consent does not apply, a promise of earnings, urgency or scarcity
 * with nothing real behind it, or resale rights without a license; a warning
 * raised for the creator's own site, the right price, a real deadline or a
 * held license; a warning without its passage, reason and fix; or unbounded
 * work on a huge text.
