/**
 * Counts read only in their exact shape: lesson video, a closing's told list
 * and reviews (audit SG2 L8, CX-123 rule 24).
 *
 * Each of these read a Redis reply with Number() or `|| 0`, which turns
 * null, text and garbage into 0, and so let a malformed reply count as fact:
 *
 *   - watchedIn (lib/watch.ts) read an unknown month of video as 0 seconds,
 *     and swallowed a Redis error into 0 too. It now throws, and the hourly
 *     job's per-store loop skips that store this round.
 *   - measure (lib/watch.ts) read a video's last total that was not a whole
 *     number as 0, and so counted the whole video again. Now a reply out of
 *     shape meters nothing this round (null, read again soon), and one
 *     malformed entry in a well-formed reply is resynced without counting
 *     it; never counted from 0.
 *   - measureDue (lib/watch.ts) read an unknown "last opened" as never, and
 *     took the store out of line. Unknown now keeps it in line.
 *   - toldOf (lib/closing-buyers.ts) read garbage on the told list as "told,
 *     not yet": a certain line in a person's copy of their data. It now
 *     throws, which fails the whole copy, as any read that fails does.
 *   - tellBuyers read a told list it could not read as "nobody told yet"
 *     and wrote to them all again; tellRefundShort read garbage as "told"
 *     (paid for) and the rest as not. Both now stop this round before any
 *     credit is taken or any email goes.
 *   - saveReview (lib/reviews.ts) read an unknown count of a product's
 *     reviews as 0, and let a review past the ceiling. It now refuses.
 *
 * The exact replies keep working as before.
