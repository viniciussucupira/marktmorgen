/**
 * 567 [GD1] (e): a creator hides a review only for one of the fixed review
 * rules, the same for every rating, and the reason is kept with the review
 * (lib/review-summary.ts HIDE_REASONS, lib/reviews.ts setHidden). Low stars or
 * criticism are never a reason. Hiding never takes stars out of the average,
 * and the stars stay on the page when every review is hidden.
 *
 * What fails here:
 *   - a review hidden with no reason, or with a reason not on the list;
 *   - a reason about stars, criticism or how negative a review is;
 *   - a rule that treats a low-rated review differently from a high-rated one;
 *   - the reason lost when the review is read again, or kept after it is shown again;
 *   - the stars gone from a page whose reviews are all hidden;
 *   - the studio offering a hide without the reasons, or the API taking one.
