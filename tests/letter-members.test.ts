/**
 * Published emails kept for members (queue items 28 [E11] and 100
 * [E2-MEMBER-PUBLICATIONS], unit 1, added 4 November 2026): lib/letter-rules.ts,
 * lib/letters.ts, lib/letter-access.ts, the email's page, the list and the
 * routes, against a stand-in for the creator's Stripe account and the email
 * service.
 *
 * Checked:
 *
 *   - the creator chooses the products when publishing; only this store's
 *     products, at most MAX_LETTER_PRODUCTS; nothing chosen keeps an email
 *     exactly as it was (everyone reads it, the same copy, the same page);
 *   - the page shows the words only to the creator and to a proved address
 *     that holds a product now; a visitor, a pass for one course only and an
 *     address that holds nothing see the subject, who it is for and the form;
 *   - a refund in full closes it once the kept answer runs out;
 *   - the emailed link is sent only to an address that holds a product, the
 *     form answers the same either way, and opening it lets the browser in;
 *   - the words never reach the list, the page's metadata, or any public
 *     place: only the pages, the studio, its routes and the closing walk
 *     read the copies.
