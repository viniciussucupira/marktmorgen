/**
 * Forgetting a Discord server (lib/discord-store.ts, forgetServer), on "Disconnect the server" in the studio
 * (app/api/store/discord/route.ts). The proof is Claude 6's (tests/discord-forget-unknown-proof.test.ts on
 * claude6/c5-proofs): an unknown HVALS reply was read as "no members", so the links from each buyer's address to
 * their Discord id (nl:dc:addr:*) outlived the disconnect, and an unknown HKEYS reply left the members' due
 * entries behind. Read exactly now (CX-123 rule 24, lib/redis-reply.ts): an unknown reply throws before anything is
 * deleted, so everything is kept for the next try, and the studio hears an honest "not_finished" (503), never
 * "disconnected" with a buyer's address still kept. Synthetic data, the memory Redis and a stand-in for Discord.
