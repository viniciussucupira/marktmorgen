/**
 * A store's rates beside stores its size (lib/benchmark-rules.ts,
 * lib/benchmarks.ts; added 13 October 2026). Checked:
 *
 *   - a store's four rates over 90 days, each only once its own counts mean
 *     something, and its size band by visitors;
 *   - a band shows a range for a rate only from 10 stores, as its middle
 *     half and median;
 *   - where a store sits, with fewer refunds counted as the better side;
 *   - samples kept by the week, the latest of each store used, the demo
 *     store and suspended ones never in them.
