/**
 * Getting in without the second step (lib/two-step.ts enterLocked) starts the
 * RESET_DAYS clock only for a login that really opened (Claude 5 on #2948).
 *
 * The first such login writes the day two-step login turns off, then opens a
 * locked session, then tells the sign-in and recovery addresses. When the
 * session does not open (its lock not confirmed, the request failed) or the
 * recovery lock cannot be aligned, nobody got in and nobody was told: the day
 * is taken back, so two-step login never turns off by itself on a login that
 * never happened, and a session opened on the way is taken back too. A day
 * already set by an earlier login is never moved or taken back.
 *
 * Synthetic accounts, Redis stand-in, emails caught here.
