"""The final check of a workflow: one result that says whether every job of it passed.

GitHub can require a check by name before a pull request enters main. A job that a
matrix expands, or that is skipped, reports under a different name, so requiring each
job by name would leave every documentation-only pull request waiting forever. Each
workflow therefore ends with this one job, which always runs and reads the result of
every other job of the same workflow:

- every job succeeded: pass;
- documentation-scope succeeded and said the change is documentation only
  (outputs.full == "false"), and every other job succeeded or was skipped: pass;
- anything else (a failure, a cancellation, a skip without that proof, a missing
  result or a failed documentation-scope): fail.

A pass here never replaces a test; it only repeats the results of the jobs it reads.
scripts/test_ci_all_checks.py holds the rules and checks that every workflow has
this job, that it depends on every other job and that it always runs.
