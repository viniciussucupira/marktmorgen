/**
 * Builds every tests/security/*.redis-run.ts with the application's real
 * Redis client (lib/redis.ts) and runs each one: called by
 * scripts/test_security_redis.py, which serves Redis to them. A journey may
 * stand in for a module Next.js provides at request time (next/headers), or
 * one only its own build can load (next/og), and the file store, which a
 * journey must never reach (lib/blob.ts), is answered by a stand-in: the
 * stand-ins sit beside the journeys, in tests/security/, and say what they do.
 * One failing journey fails the whole check; each runs in a process of its
 * own, against a database emptied between them.
